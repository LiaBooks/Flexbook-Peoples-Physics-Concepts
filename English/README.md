## 1.0 Units and Problem Solving

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/1.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

Units identify what a specific number refers to. For instance, the number 42 can be used to represent 42 miles, 42 pounds, or 42 elephants! Numbers are _mathematical_ objects, but units give them _physical_ meaning. Keeping track of units can help you avoid mistakes when you work out problems.

### 1.1 Metric Units

<article>

 

Every answer to a physics problem must include units. Even if a problem explicitly asks for a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") in meters per second (m/s), the answer is 5 m/s, not 5.

If a unit is named after a person, it is capitalized. So you write “10 Newtons,” or “10 N,” but “10 meters,” or “10 m.”

Metric units use a base numbering system of 10. Thus a centimeter is ten times larger than a millimeter. A decimeter is 10 times larger than a centimeter and a meter is 10 times larger than a decimeter. Thus a meter is 100 times larger than a centimeter and 1000 times larger than a millimeter. Going the other way, one can say that there are 100 cm contained in a meter.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Convert 2500 m/s into km/s

A km (kilometer) is 1000 times bigger than a meter. Thus, one simply divides by 1000 and arrives at 2.5 km/s

#### Example 2

The lengths of the sides of a cube are doubling each second. At what rate is the volume increasing?

The cube side length, $x$, is doubling every second. Therefore after 1 second it becomes $2{x}$. The volume of the first cube of side ${x}$ is ${x}\times{x}\times{x}={{x}^3}$. The volume of the second cube of side $2{x}$ is $2{x}\times2{x}\times2{x}={8{x}^3}$. The ratio of the second volume to the first volume is ${8{x}^3}/{{x}^3}=8$. Thus the volume is increasing by a factor of 8 every second.

### 1.2 Unit Conversions

<article>

The key to converting units is to multiply by a clever factor of one. You can always multiply by 1, because it does not change the number. Since 1 in. is equal to 2.54 cm, then $1 = {\frac{2.54 \;\mathrm{cm}}{1 \;\mathrm{in}}} = {\frac{1 \;\mathrm{in}}{2.54 \;\mathrm{cm}}}$. Thus, one can multiply by this form of 1 in order to cancel units (see video below).

Write out every step and show all your units cancelling as you go.

When converting speeds from metric to American units, remember the following rule of thumb: a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") measured in mi/hr is about double the value measured in m/s (_i.e.,_ $10 \mathrm{m/s}$ is equal to about 20 MPH). Remember that the speed itself hasn’t changed, just our representation of the speed in a certain set of units.

When you’re not sure how to approach a problem, you can often get insight by considering how to obtain the units of the desired result by combining the units of the given variables. For instance, if you are given a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") (in meters) and a time (in hours), the only way to obtain units of speed (meters/hour) is to divide the distance by the time. This is a simple example of a method called _dimensional analysis_, which can be used to find equations that govern various physical situations without any knowledge of the phenomena themselves.

## 2.0 One-Dimensional Motion

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/3.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

One dimensional motion describes objects moving in straight lines. Speed is a scalar measure of how quickly an object is moving along this line. Velocity is speed with a direction, making it a vector. If an object’s velocity changes with time, the object is said to be accelerating. When restricted to one dimension, there are only two possible directions for the velocity and acceleration vectors to point in. As we’ll see in the next chapters, understanding an object's acceleration is the key to understanding its motion.



</article>

### 2.1 Position and Displacement

<article>

Position is the location of the object (whether it's a person, a ball, or a particle) at a given moment in time. Displacement is the difference in the object's position from one time to another. [Distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "Distance") is the total amount the object has traveled in a certain period of time. Displacement is a vector quantity (direction matters), where as distance is a scalar (only the amount matters). Distance and displacement are the same in the case where the object travels in a straight line and always moving in the same direction.

When beginning a one dimensional problem, define a positive direction. The other direction is then taken to be negative. Traditionally, "positive" is taken to mean "to the right"; however, any definition of direction used consistently throughout the problem will yield the right answer.

### Examples

#### Example 1

An indecisive car goes 120 m North, then 30 m south then 60m North. What is the car's distance and displacement?

Distance is the total amount traveled. Thus distance = 120 + 30 + 60 m = 210 m

Displacement is the amount displaced from the starting position. Thus displacement = 120 - 30 + 60 m = 150 m.

#### Example 2

An $8^{\text{th}}$ grader is timed to run 24 feet in 12 seconds, what is her [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") in meters per second?

$$
\begin{align*}
D & = vt\\
24 \ ft & = v(12 \ s)\\ 
v & = 24 \ ft/12 \ s = 2 \ ft/s\\
v & = 2 \ ft/s \ast (1 m/3.28 \ ft) = 0.61 \ m/s
\end{align*}
$$

### 2.2 Average Velocity

<article>

**[Speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "Speed")** is the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") traveled divided by the time it took to travel that distance.

**[Velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "Velocity")** is the instantaneous speed and direction.

**Average** velocity is the displacement divided by the time.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Pacific loggerhead sea turtles migrate over 7,500 miles (12,000 km) between nesting beaches in Japan and feeding grounds off the coast of Mexico. If the average speed of a loggerhead is about 45 km/day, how long does it take for it to complete the distance of a one-way migration?

Question:  $t = ?$ \[days\]

Given: $d = 12,000 \ km$

${\;} \qquad v_{avg} = 45 \ km/day$

Equations: $v_{avg} = \frac{d}{t}$ therefore $t = \frac{d}{v_{avg}}$

Plug n' Chug: $t = \frac{d}{v_{avg}} = \frac{12,000 \ km}{45 \ km/day} = 267 \ days$

The answer is 267 days.

### 2.3 Velocity and Acceleration

<article>

[Acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "Acceleration") is the rate of change of [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity"). So in other words, acceleration tells you how quickly the velocity is increasing or decreasing. An acceleration of $5 \ m/s^2$ indicates that the velocity is increasing by $5 m/s$ in the positive direction every second.

Gravity near the Earth pulls an object downwards toward the surface of the Earth with an acceleration of $9.8 \ m/s^2 ( \approx 10 \ m/s^2)$. In the absence of air [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance"), all objects will fall with the same acceleration. The letter $g$ is used as the symbol for the acceleration of gravity.

When talking about an object's acceleration, whether it is due to gravity or not, the acceleration of gravity is sometimes used as a unit of measurement where $1g=9.8m/s^2$. So an object accelerating at 2g's is accelerating at $2*9.8m/s^2$ or $19.6m/s^2$

**Deceleration** is the term used when an object’s _[speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed")_ (i.e. magnitude of its velocity) is decreasing due to acceleration in the opposite direction of its velocity.

### Examples

#### Example 1

A Top Fuel dragster can accelerate from 0 to 100 mph (160 km/hr) in 0.8 seconds. What is the [average acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/2.4/primary/lesson/average-acceleration-phys "average acceleration") in $m/s^2$?

Question: $a_{avg} = ? \ [m/s^2]$

Given: $v_i = 0 \ m/s$

 ${\;} \qquad \ \ v_f = 160 \ km/hr$

${\;} \qquad \ \quad t = 0.8 \ s$

Equations: $a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v }{t}$

Plug n' Chug: Convert km/hr to m/s

$v_f = \left( 160 \frac{km}{hr} \right ) \left( \frac{1,000 \ m}{1 \ km} \right ) \left ( \frac{1 \ hr}{3,600 \ s} \right ) = 44.4 \ m/s$

Solve for average acceleration

$a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{44.4 \ m/s - 0 \ m/s}{0.8 \ s} = 56 \ m/s^2$

The answer is 56 m/s_2_.  
Note that this is over $5 \frac{1}{2}$ g’s!

One must first read a graph correctly. For example on a position vs. time graph (thus the position is graphed on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis) for a given a data point, go straight down from it to get the time and straight across to get the position.

If there is constant [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") the graph $x$ vs. $t$ produces a parabola. The slope of the $x$ vs. $t$ graph equals the [instantaneous velocity](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/2.3/primary/lesson/instantaneous-velocity-phys "instantaneous velocity"). The slope of a $v$ vs. $t$ graph equals the acceleration.

The **slope** of the graph $v$ vs. $t$ can be used to find **acceleration;** the **area** of the graph $v$ vs. $t$ can be used to find **displacement.** Welcome to calculus!

For a graph of position vs. time. The slope is the rise over the run, where the rise is the displacement and the run is the time. thus,

Slope = $v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$

Slope of the tangent line for a particular point in time = the instantaneous velocity

For a graph of [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") vs. time. The slope is the rise over the run, where the rise is the change in velocity and the run is the time. thus,

Slope = $a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

Slope of the tangent line for a particular point in time = the instantaneous acceleration

### 2.5 Motion

<article>

When beginning a one dimensional problem, define a positive direction. The other direction is then taken to be negative. Traditionally, "positive" is taken to mean "up" for vertical problems and "to the right" for horizontal problems; however, any definition of direction used consistency throughout the problem will yield the right answer.

Gravity near the Earth pulls an object toward the surface of the Earth with an [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") of $9.8 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2$$(\approx10 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2)$. In the absence of air [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance"), all objects will fall with the same acceleration. Air resistance can cause low-mass, large area objects to accelerate more slowly.

The Big Three equations define the graphs of position and [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") as a function of time. When there is no acceleration (constant velocity), position increases linearly with time -- [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") equals rate times time. Under constant acceleration, velocity increases linearly with time but distance does so at a quadratic rate. The slopes of the position and velocity graphs will give [instantaneous velocity](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/2.3/primary/lesson/instantaneous-velocity-phys "instantaneous velocity") and acceleration, respectively.

### Examples

#### Example 1

While driving through Napa you observe a hot air balloon in the sky with tourists on board. One of the passengers accidentally drops a wine bottle and you note that it takes 2.3 seconds for it to reach the ground. (a) How high is the balloon? (b) What was the wine bottle’s velocity just before it hit the ground?

(a) Question: $h = ? [m]$

Given: $t = 2.3 \ s$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10 \ m/s^2$

${\;} \qquad \quad v_i = 0 \ m/s$

Equations:$\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ or $h = v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

Plug n' Chug:$h = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(10 \ m/s^2)(2.3 \ s)^2 = 26.5 \ m$

The answer is 26.5 m.

(b) Question: $v_f = ? [m/s]$

_Given: (same as above)_

Equation:$v_f = v_i + at$

Plug n' Chug:$v_f = v_i +at = 0 + (10 \ m/s^2)(2.3 \ s) = 23 \ m/s$

The answer is 23 m/s.

#### Example 2

The second tallest building in the world is the Petronas Tower in Malaysia. If you were to drop a penny from the roof which is 378.6 m (1242 ft) high, how long would it take to reach the ground? You may neglect air [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction").

Question: $t = ? [s]$

Given:$h = 378.6 \ m$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10 \ m/s^2$

${\;} \qquad \quad v_i = 0 \ m/s$

Equations:$\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ or $h = v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

Plug n' Chug: Since $v_i = 0$, the equation simplifies to $h = \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ rearranging for the unknown variable, $t$, yields

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(378.6 \ m)}{10.0 \ m/s^2}} = 8.70 \ s$

The answer is 8.70 s.

## 3.0 Two-Dimensional and Projectile Motion

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/17.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

In this chapter, we explore the motion of projectiles under the influence of gravity --- fired cannonballs, thrown basketballs, and other objects that have no way of propelling themselves and do not experience significant air resistance. We know that vectors can be separated into components (see first lesson); if they are separated into perpendicular components the motion along each component can be treated independently.

This is the insight that allows us to solve two dimensional projectile motion problems: we break any initial velocity vector into a component parallel to the ground and a component perpendicular to it. The force of gravity --- which will be explained in more detail later --- accelerates any object near the surface of the earth toward its center at a rate of $g = 9.8 \mathrm{m/s^2}$. This acceleration is in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the earth, conventionally labeled $y$.

Since in projectile motion under the sole influence of gravity any acceleration the object experiences is in the $y$ direction, its horizontal, or $x$, velocity remains constant throughout its flight (at least in the absence of air resistance, which we ignore for the time being). To solve two dimensional motion problems, we apply the kinematics equations of one-dimensional motion to each of the two directions. In the $y$ direction, we can use the uniform acceleration equations to solve for time in flight. Using this time, we can find how far the object traveled in the $x$ direction also.



</article>

### 3.1 Vectors

<article>

 

In order to solve two dimensional problems it is necessary to break all vectors into their x and y components. Different dimensions do not 'talk' to each other. Thus one must use the equations of motion once for the x-direction and once for the y-direction. For example, when working with the x-direction, one only includes the x-component values of the vectors in the calculations. Note that if an object is 'launched horizontally', then the full value is in the x-direction and there is no component in the y-direction.

### Vectors

The first new concept introduced here is that of a vector: a scalar magnitude with a direction. In a sense, we are almost as good at natural vector manipulation as we are at adding numbers. Consider, for instance, throwing a ball to a friend standing some [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") away. To perform an accurate throw, one has to figure out both where to throw and how hard. We can represent this concept graphically with an arrow: it has an obvious direction, and its length can represent the distance the ball will travel in a given time. Such a vector (an arrow between the original and final location of an object) is called a displacement:

![0](media/18.png "Figure 1: #### Vector Components")

From the above examples, it should be clear that two vectors add to make another vector. Sometimes, the opposite operation is useful: we often want to represent a vector as the sum of two other vectors. This is called breaking a vector into its components. When vectors point along the same line, they essentially add as scalars. If we break vectors into components along the same lines, we can add them by adding their components. The lines we pick to break our vectors into components along are often called a **basis**. Any basis will work in the way described above, but we usually break vectors into _perpendicular_ components, since it will frequently allow us to use the Pythagorean theorem in time-saving ways. Specifically, we usually use the $x$ and $y$ axes as our basis, and therefore break vectors into what we call their $x$ and $y$ components:

![0](media/19.png "Figure 2: A final reason for breaking vectors into perpendicular components is that they are in a sense independent: adding vectors along a component perpendicular to an original component one will _never_ change the original component, just like changing the $y$\-coordinate of a point can never change its $x$\-coordinate.")

#### Example 1

A tennis ball is launched $32^\circ$ above the horizontal at a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of 7.0 m/s. What are the horizontal and vertical velocity components?

Question: $v_x$ and $v_y = \ ? \ [m/s]$

Given: $v = 7.0 \ m/s$

${\;} \qquad \quad \theta = 32^\circ$

Equations: $v_x = v \cos \theta \qquad v_y = v \sin \theta$

Plug n' chug: $v_x = v \cos \theta = (7.0 \ m/s) \cos (32^\circ)=5.9 \ m/s$

${\;}\qquad \qquad \qquad \ v_y = v \sin \theta = (7.0 \ m/s) \sin (32^\circ)= 3.7 \ m/s$

The answer is 5.9 m/s, 3.7 m/s.

### 3.2 Velocity

<article>

 

The only equation you need is that displacement in a certain direction equals the component of velocity in that direction multiplied by the time it takes. You'll use this once for the x-direction and once for the y-direction and solve for what is asked.

> ### Key Equations

> $v_{x} = v \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal.

> $v_{y} = v \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal.
> 
> $\Delta x = v_{x} t$

### Examples

#### Example 1

If a river is flowing north at 2 m/s and you swim straight across (i.e. east) at 1.5 m/s, how far up shore will you be from your starting point once you reach the other side? The river is 9 m wide.

First, solve for the time it takes you to reach the other side. Let's let north be the y-direction and the direction across the river be the x-direction.

$\Delta x = v_{x} t$

$9 m = 1.5 m/s \times t$

thus, $t = 6 s$

Now, use the time you are in the water to find how far the river has carried you north.

$\Delta y = v_{y} t$

$\Delta y = 2 m/s \times 6 s$

$\Delta y = 12 m$

1.  If a river is flowing south at 4 m/s and you swim straight across (i.e. east) at 2 m/s; admittedly, you're going to drift a bit south. That said, calculate that distance that you drifted south from your starting point. The river is 16 m wide.
2.  If a river is flowing south at 3 m/s and you swim at an angle of 30 degrees north of directly east at 1 m/s, how far did you drift up or down stream from your starting point once you reach the other side? The river is 10 m wide.
3.  If a river is flowing north at 2 m/s and you can swim at 4 m/s, what angle should you swim at such that you arrive directly across the river (i.e. no drift north or south from starting point on other side)? The river is 10 m wide.
4.  If a river is flowing south at 5 m/s and you can swim at 4 m/s maximum, is it possible to arrive directly across? Why or why not?

### 3.3 Projectile Motion

<article>

 

Motion in one direction is unrelated to motion in other perpendicular directions. Once the object has been thrown, the only [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") is in the $y$ (up/down) direction due to gravity. The $x$ (right/left) direction [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") remains unchanged.

In projectile motion, the horizontal displacement of an object from its starting point is called its _range._

Vertical ($y$) [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") is zero only at the highest point of a thrown object's flight.

Since in the absence of air [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, this component of velocity does not change over time. This is a counter-intuitive notion for many. (Air resistance will cause velocity to decrease slightly or significantly depending on the object. But this factor is ignored for the time being.)

Motion in the vertical direction must include the [acceleration due to gravity](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/2.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-due-to-gravity-phys "acceleration due to gravity"), and therefore the velocity in the vertical direction changes over time.

The shape of the path of an object undergoing projectile motion in two dimensions is a parabola.

    6.  Suppose a hunter fires his gun. Suppose as well that as the bullet flies out horizontally and undergoes projectile motion, the shell for the bullet falls directly downward. Then, the shell hits the ground before the bullet.
3.  Imagine the path of a soccer ball in projectile motion. Which of the following is true at the highest point in its flight?
    1.  $v_x = 0, v_y = 0, a_x =0, a_y = 0$.
    2.  $v_x > 0, v_y = 0, a_x =0, a_y = 0$.
    3.  $v_x = 0, v_y = 0, a_x =0, a_y = -9.8\;\mathrm{m/s}^2$.
    4.  $v_x > 0, v_y = 0, a_x =0, a_y = -9.8\;\mathrm{m/s}^2$.
4.  A hunter with an air blaster gun is preparing to shoot at a monkey hanging from a tree. He is pointing his gun directly at the monkey. The monkey’s got to think quickly! What is the monkey’s best chance to avoid being smacked by the rubber ball?
    1.  The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will pass beneath him due to gravity.
    2.  The monkey should let go when the hunter fires. Since the gun is pointing right at him, he can avoid getting hit by falling to the ground.
    3.  The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will sail above him since its vertical velocity increases by $9.8 \;\mathrm{m/s}$ every second of flight.
    4.  The monkey should let go when the hunter fires. He will fall faster than the bullet due to his greater mass, and it will fly over his head.
5.  You are riding your bike in a straight line with a speed of $10 \;\mathrm{m/s}$. You accidentally drop your calculator out of your backpack from a height of $2.0 \;\mathrm{m}$ above the ground.

### 3.4 Projectile Motion Problem Solving

<article>

 

It is necessary to understand how to break a vector into its x and y components in order to solve problems for projectiles.

#### Break the Initial Velocity Vector into its Components

![0](media/26.png "Figure 1: #### Apply the Kinematics Equations")

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Vertical Direction}    &&   \textbf{Horizontal Direction}\\
y(t)  = y_i +v_{iy} t - \tfrac{1}{2} g t^2    &&         x(t) = x_{i} +v_{ix}t\\
v_{y}(t)  = v_{iy} -gt           &&                                         v_{x}(t) = v_{ix} \\
{v_y}^2  = {v_{0y}}^2 - 2g (\Delta y)              && \\
a_y = -g = -9.8 \mathrm{m/s^2}  \approx -10\mathrm{m/s^2}  &&         a_x = 0\\
\end{align*}
$$

To work these problems, separate the “Big Three” equations into two sets: one for the vertical direction, and one for the horizontal. Keep them separate.

The only variable that can go into both sets of equations is time; use time to communicate between the x and y components of the object's motion.

### Examples

#### Example 1

CSI discovers a car at the bottom of a 72 m cliff. How fast was the car going if it landed 22m horizontally from the cliff’s edge? (Note that the cliff is flat, i.e. the car came off the cliff horizontally).

$v = \ ? \ [m/s]$

Given: $h = \Delta y = 72 \ m$

${\;}\qquad \quad d = \Delta x = 22 \ m$

${\;}\qquad \quad g = 10.0 \ m/s^2$

Equation: $h = v_{iy} t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ and $d = v_{ix} t$

Plug n’ Chug:

Step 1: Calculate the time required for the car to freefall from a height of 72 m.

$h = v_{iy} t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ but since $v_{iy}=0$, the equation simplifies to $h = \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ rearranging for the unknown variable, $t$, yields

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(72 \ m)}{10.0 \ m/s^2}} = 3.79 \ s$

Step 2: Solve for initial [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity"):

$v_{ix} = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{22 \ m}{3.79 \ s} = 5.80 \ m/s$

The answer is 5.80 m/s.

#### Example 2

A ball of mass $m$ is moving horizontally with a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of $v_i$ off a cliff of height $h$. How much time does it take the ball to travel from the edge of the cliff to the ground? Express your answer in terms of $g$ ([acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") due to gravity) and $h$ (height of the cliff).

Since we are solving or how long it takes for the ball to reach ground, any motion in the $x$ direction is not pertinent. To make this problem a little simpler, we will define down as the positive direction and the top of the cliff to be:

$$
y=0
$$

In this solution we will use the equation:

$$
y(t)=y_o+v_{oy}t+\frac{1}{2}gt^2
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
y(t)&=y_o+v_{oy}t+\frac{1}{2}gt^2 && \text{start with the equation}\\
h&=y_o+v_{oy}t+\frac{1}{2}gt^2 && \text{substitute } h \text{ for } y(t) \text{ because that's the position of the ball}\\ 
& && \text{when it hits the ground after time } t\\
h&=0+v_{oy}+\frac{1}{2}gt^2 && \text{substitute } 0 \text{ for } y_o \text{ because the ball starts at the top of the cliff}\\
h&=0+0+\frac{1}{2}gt^2 && \text{substitute } 0 \text{ for } v_{oy} \text{ because the ball starts with}\\
& && \text{no vertical component to its velocity}\\
h&=\frac{1}{2}gt^2 && \text{simplify the equation}\\
t&=\sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} && \text{solve for } t\\
\end{align*}
$$

## 4.0 Newton's Laws

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/30.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

Applied forces may cause objects to accelerate. All forces come in pairs because they arise in the interaction of two objects — you can’t push without being pushed back! The more force applied, the greater the acceleration that is produced. Objects with high masses are difficult to accelerate without a large force. In the absence of applied forces, objects move in a straight line at a constant speed (or remain at rest). In formal language:

> __Newton's First Law__
> 
> _Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right_ (straight) _line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it._
> 
> __Newton's Second Law__
> 
> _To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts._

(Taken from the Principia in modern English, Isaac Newton, University of California Press, 1934).

Understanding motion comes in two stages. The first stage you’ve already seen: you can figure out where something will go, and how fast it will get there, if you know its acceleration. The second stage is much more interesting: where did the acceleration come from? How can you predict the amount of acceleration? Mastering both stages is the key to understanding motion.

### 4.1 Newton's First Law

<article>

Newton's First Law is about [inertia](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.2/primary/lesson/inertia-ms-ps "inertia"); objects at rest stay at rest unless acted upon and objects in motion continue that motion in a straight line unless acted upon. Prior to Newton and Galileo, the prevailing view on motion was still Aristotle's. According to his theory the natural state of things is at rest; force is required to keep something moving at a constant rate. This made sense to people throughout history because on earth, [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") and air [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") slow moving objects. When there is no air resistance (or other sources of friction), a situation approximated in space, Newton's first law is much more evident.

The amount of inertia an object has is simply related to the mass of the object. Mass and [Weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "Weight") are two different things. Mass (typically in units of kg or grams) is basically a measure of what comprises an object. Weight is the measure of how much the force of gravity is pulling on you. In fact, instead of saying 'I weigh 80 lb.', one could say that 'the force of gravity is pulling on me with a force of 80 lb.' The metric unit for weight (and force) is the Newton.

### 

$$
F_g =  mg
$$

The force of gravity (i.e. your weight) is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") of gravity for that planet.

$$
1 \text{lb.}  =  4.45 \text{N}
$$

An object will not change its state of motion (i.e., accelerate) unless a net force acts on it. Equal and oppositely directed forces do not produce acceleration.

If no net force acts on an object the object remains at constant [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") or at rest.

### Examples

#### Example 1

What is the weight of a 90 kg person on Earth? What about the moon?

On Earth:

$$
F_g = mg = (90 \ kg)(9.8 \ m/s^2) = 882 \ N
$$

On moon:

$$
F_g = mg = (90 \ kg)(1.6 \ m/s^2) = 144 \ N
$$

1.  When hit from behind in a car crash, a passenger can suffer a neck injury called whiplash. Explain in terms of inertia how this occurs, and how headrests can prevent the injury.
2.  A cheetah can outrun a gazelle in a short straight race, but the gazelle can escape with its life by zigzagging. The cheetah is more massive than the gazelle – explain how this strategy works.
3.  If your hammer develops a loose head, you can tighten it by banging it on the ground. A little physics secret though – it’s better to bang the hammer _head up_ rather than _head down_. Explain, using inertia.
4.  If a man weighs 140 lb. on Earth, what is his weight in Newtons and his mass in kg?

### **Review (Answers)**

1.  The passenger's head will remain at rest for the split second when the seat exerts a big force on the passenger's back causing a "whiplash" on your neck. This is an example of newton's first law because your head is not acted on by an unbalanced force while the rest of your body is. A head rest causes your head to accelerate with the rest of your body.
2.  The cheetah must exert a bigger force to change directions than the gazelle because the cheetah has more inertia. This extra force needed for the cheetah to change directions allows the gazelle to get away.
3.  The head of the hammer has more inertia than the tail. So when you bang the hammer "head up" the head exerts a large force on the rest of the hammer in order to come to a stop.
4.  620 N, 62 kg (using 10 m/s_2_) for acceleration of gravity)

### 4.2 Newton's Second Law

<article>

 

The [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") experienced by an object will be proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to its mass. If there are multiple forces, they can be added as [vectors](/c/physics/vectors "vectors") and it is the _net_ force that matters.

Newton's Second Law describes his famous equation for the motion of an object:

___The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right_ (straight) _line in which that force is impressed.___

_The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right_ (straight) _line in which that force is impressed._

The "motion" Newton mentions in the Second Law is, in his language, the product of the mass and [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of an object --- we call this quantity [momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.7/primary/lesson/momentum-ms-ps "momentum") --- so the Second Law is actually the famous equation**:**

To calculate the net force on an object, you need to calculate all the individual forces acting on the object and then add them as vectors. This requires some mathematical skill.

### 4.3 Newton's Third Law

<article>

Newton's Third Law states for every force there is an equal but opposite reaction force. To distinguish a third law pair from merely oppositely directed pairs is difficult, but very important. Third law pairs must obey three rules: (1) Third law force pairs must be of the same type of force. (2) Third law force pairs are exerted on two different objects. (3) Third law force pairs are equal in magnitude and oppositely directed.

$\vec{F} = - \vec{F'}$

Consider a block sitting on a table. The Earth’s gravity on the block and the force of the table on the block are equal and opposite. But these are not third law pairs, because they are both on the same object and the forces are of different types. The proper third law pairs are: (1) earth’s gravity on block/block’s gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on block/ block pushes on table.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Tom and Mary are standing on identical skateboards. Tom and Mary push off of each other and travel in opposite directions.

a) If Tom $(M)$ and Mary $(m)$ have identical masses, who travels farther?

b) If Tom has a bigger mass than Mary, who goes farther?

c) If Tom and Mary have identical masses and Tom pushes twice as hard as Mary, who goes farther?

a) Neither. Both Tom and Mary will travel the same [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance"). The forced applied to each person is the same (Newton's Third Law). So 

$$
\cancel{M}a=\cancel{m}{a}
$$

 which cancels to 

$$
a=a
$$

 Therefore both people will travel the same distance because the [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") controls how far someone will travel and Tom and Mary have equal acceleration.

b) Mary will go farther. Again, the same force is applied to both Mary and Tom so 

$$
Ma=ma
$$

 Since Tom has the larger mass, his acceleration must be smaller (acceleration and mass are inversely proportional). Finally, because Mary's acceleration is greater, she will travel farther.

c) Neither. Newton's Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore if Tom pushes twice as hard as Mary, Mary will essentially be pushing back with the same strength. They will therefore travel the same distance.

### 4.4 Free Body Diagrams

<article>

For every problem involving forces it is essential to draw a free body diagram (FBD) before proceeding to the problem solving stage. The FBD allows one to visualize the situation and also to make sure all the forces are accounted. In addition, a very solid understanding of the physics is gleaned and many questions can be answered solely from the FBD.

### Review 

1.  Draw free body diagrams (FBDs) for all of the following objects involved (in **bold**) and label all the forces appropriately. Make sure the lengths of the vectors in your FBDs are proportional to the strength of the force: smaller forces get shorter arrows!
    1.  A **man** stands in an elevator that is accelerating upward at $2 \ m/s^2$.
    2.  A boy is dragging a **sled** at a constant speed. The boy is pulling the sled with a rope at a $30^\circ$ angle.
    3.  The **picture**shown here is attached to the ceiling by three wires.

    4.  A **bowling ball** rolls down a lane at a constant velocity.
        
    5.  A **car** accelerates down the road. There is friction $f$ between the tires and the road.
        
2.  For the following situation, identify the $3^{rd}$ law force pairs on the associated free body diagrams. Label each member of one pair $A$, each member of the next pair $B$, and so on. The spring is stretched so that it is pulling the block of wood to the right. ![0](media/42.png)\[Figure 3\]Draw free body diagrams for the situation below. Notice that we are pulling the bottom block _out from beneath_ the top block. There is friction between the blocks! After you have drawn your FBDs, identify the $3^{rd}$ law force pairs, as above. ![0](media/43.png)\[Figure 4\]

### 4.5 Friction

<article>

 

The force of **friction** can actually be described in terms of the _coefficient of friction,_ $\mu$. It is determined experimentally and varies depending upon the two surfaces in contact. **Static friction** ($\mu_s$) acts between two surfaces that are in contact but not in motion with respect to each other. This force prevents objects from sliding. It always opposes potential motion, and it rises in magnitude to a maximum value given by the formula below. **Kinetic friction** ($\mu_k$) acts between two surfaces that are in contact and in motion with respect to each other. This force reduces the [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") and it always opposes the direction of motion.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Static and Kinetic Friction}
\begin{cases}
f_s \le \mu_s | F_N| & \text{Opposes potential motion of surfaces in contact}\\
f_k = \mu_k | F_N| & \text{Opposes motion of surfaces in contact}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

### Examples

#### Example 1

Calculate the force necessary to slide a 4.7-kg chair across a room at a constant [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the chair and the floor is 0.68.Example 1

![0](media/44.png "Figure 1: $F = ? [N]$")

Given:

$m = 4.7\ kg$

${\;}\qquad \quad \mu_k = 0.68$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10.0\ m/s^2$

Equations:

$\sum F = ma$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad \sum F_y = N - mg = 0, \text{so}\ N = mg$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x$



$$
{\;}\qquad \ \qquad F_{\text{pull}} - f_k = 0 \ (\text{because the chair is moving at}\ constant \ speed,\  \text{so}\ a=0)
$$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad F_{\text{pull}} = \mu_k N$

Plug n’ Chug:

The force necessary to move the chair at a constant speed is equal to the frictional force between the chair and the floor. However in order to calculate the frictional force you must first determine the normal force which is (in this case) equal to the [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") (i.e. $F_g$) of the chair.

$$
\begin{align*}
N & = mg = (4.7 \ kg)(10 \ m/s^2) = 47 \ N \\
F_{\text{pull}}  &= \mu_k \ N = (0.68)(47 \ N) = 32 \ N
\end{align*}
$$

The answer is 32 N.

### Review

1.  Nathan pulls his little brother in a wagon, using a rope inclined at $30^\circ$ above the horizontal. The wagon and brother have a total mass of 80 kg, the average coefficient of friction between the wagon wheels and the floor is 0.08, and Nathan pulls on the rope with a force of 100 N. ![0](media/46.png)\[Figure 3\]
    1.  Draw a force diagram for the wagon, labeling all forces.
    2.  Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of Nathan’s pull. Label them on your diagram (use dotted lines for components so as not to confuse them with other forces).
    3.  Calculate the normal force acting on the wagon. (HINT: It is NOT equal to the weight! Use your FBD above).
    4.  Calculate the force of friction on the wagon.
    5.  Calculate the horizontal acceleration of the wagon.
2.  When the 20 kg box to the right is pulled with a force of 100 N, it just starts to move (i.e. the maximum value of static friction is overcome with a force of 100 N). What is the value of the coefficient of static friction, $\mu_S$? ![0](media/47.png)\[Figure 4\]
3.  A different box, this time 5 kg in mass, is being pulled with a force of 20 N and is sliding with an acceleration of $2 \ m/s^2$. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction, $\mu_K$.
4.  The large box on the table is $30 \;\mathrm{kg}$ and is connected via a rope and pulley to a smaller $10 \;\mathrm{kg}$ box, which is hanging. The $10 \;\mathrm{kg}$ mass is the highest mass you can hang without moving the box on the table. Find the coefficient of static friction $\mu_S$. ![0](media/48.png)\[Figure 5\]
5.  A block has a little block hanging out to its side, as shown: ![0](media/49.png)\[Figure 6\]As you know, if the situation is left like this, the little block will just fall. But if we accelerate the leftmost block to the right, this will create a normal force between the little block and the big block, and if there is a coefficient of friction between them, then the little block won’t slide down! Clever, eh?
    1.  The mass of the little block is $0.15 \;\mathrm{kg}$. What frictional force is required to keep it from falling? (State a magnitude and direction.)
    2.  If both blocks are accelerating to the right with an acceleration $a = 14.0 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2$, what is the normal force on the little block provided by the big block?
    3.  What is the minimum coefficient of static friction required?

### 4.6 Pressure and Force

<article>

 

**Pressure** is often confused with force. Pressure is force spread out over an area; a small force exerted on a very small area can create a very large pressure; i.e., poke a pin into your arm!



> ### Key Equations
> 
> $P = \frac{F}{A}$  Pressure is a force exerted over some area

#### Example 1

How much pressure does a 340-g Coke can exert on a table if the diameter of the can is 8.0 cm?

![0](media/50.png "Figure 1: Question: $P = ? [Pa]$")

Given: $m = 340\ grams = 0.340\ kg$

${\;}\qquad \quad \text{diameter} = 8.0\ cm = 0.08\ m$

${\;}\qquad \quad g = 10\ m/s^2$

Equations: $P = \frac{F}{A}$ Area of a circle: $A = \pi \cdot r^2$

Plug n’ Chug: $P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{mg}{ \pi \cdot r^2} = \frac{(0.340 \ kg)\left (10 \frac{m}{s^2} \right )}{\pi \left (\frac{0.08 \ m}{2} \right )^2}= \left (\frac{3.4 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}}{5.0 \times 10^{-3} m^2} \right ) = 680 \frac{N}{m^2} = 680 \ Pa$

The answer is 680 Pa.

### Normal Force

Often, objects experience a force that pushes them into another object, but once the objects are in contact they do not any move closer together. For instance, when you stand on the surface of the earth you are obviously not accelerating toward its center. According to Newton's Laws, there must be a force opposing the earth's gravity acting on you, so that the net force on you is zero. The same also applies for your gravity acting on the earth. We call such a force the **Normal Force**. The normal force acts between any two surfaces in contact, balancing what ever force is pushing the objects together. It is actually electromagnetic in nature (like other contact forces), and arises due to the repulsion of atoms in the two objects. Here is an illustration of the Normal force on a block sitting on earth:

![0](media/51.png "Figure 1: ### Tension")

Another force that often opposes gravity is known as **tension**. This force is provided by wires and strings when they hold objects above the earth. Like the Normal Force, it is electromagnetic in nature and arises due to the intermolecular bonds in the wire or string:

![0](media/52.png "Figure 2: If the object is in equilibrium, tension must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to gravity. This force transfers the gravity acting on the object to whatever the wire or string is attached to; in the end it is usually a Normal Force --- between the earth and whatever the wire is attached to --- that ends up balancing out the force of gravity on the object.")

### Friction

[Friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "Friction") is a force that opposes motion. Any two objects in contact have what is called a mutual coefficient of friction. To find the force of friction between them, we multiply the normal force by this coefficient. Like the forces above, it arises due to electromagnetic interactions of atoms in two objects. There are actually two coefficients of friction: static and kinetic. Static friction will oppose _initial_ motion of two objects relative to each other. Once the objects are moving, however, kinetic friction will oppose their continuing motion. Kinetic friction is lower than static friction, so it is easier to keep an object in motion than to set it in motion. 

$$
\begin{align*}
f_s \le \mu_s | \vec{F_N}| && \mathrm{[5]~Static~friction~opposes~potential~motion~of~surfaces~in~contact}\\
f_k = \mu_k | \vec{F_N}| && \mathrm{[6]~Kinetic~frictions~opposes~motion~of~surfaces~in~contact}
\end{align*}
$$

 There are some things about friction that are not very intuitive:

* The magnitude of the friction force does not depend on the surface areas in contact.
* The magnitude of kinetic friction does not depend on the relative [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") or [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") of the two objects.
* Friction always points in the direction opposing motion. If the net force (not counting friction) on an object is lower than the maximum possible value of static friction, friction will be equal to the net force in magnitude and opposite in direction.

### Spring Force

Any spring has some equilibrium length, and if stretched in either direction it will push or pull with a force equal to: 

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{F_{sp}} = -k \vec{\Delta x}  && \mathrm{[7]~Force~of~spring~}\vec{\Delta x}\mathrm{~from~equilibrium}
\end{align*}
$$

### Examples

#### Example 1

A woman of mass 70.0 kg weighs herself in an elevator.

![0](media/53.png)

\[Figure 3\]__a) If she wants to weigh less, should she weigh herself when accelerating upward or downward?__

c) When the elevator is accelerating upward at 2.00 m/s_2_, what does the scale read?

a) If she wants to weigh less, she has to decrease her force (her [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") is the force) on the scale. We will use the equation 

$$
F=ma
$$

 to determine in which situation she exerts less force on the scale.

If the elevator is accelerating upward then the acceleration would be greater. She would be pushed toward the floor of the elevator making her weight increase. Therefore, she should weigh herself when the elevator is going down.

b) When the elevator is not accelerating, the scale would read $70.0\mathrm{kg}$.

c) If the elevator was accelerating upward at a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of $2.00\mathrm{m/s^2}$, then the scale would read 

$$
F=ma=70\mathrm{kg}\times (9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}+2\mathrm{m/s^2})=826\mathrm{N}
$$

 which is $82.6\mathrm{kg}$.

#### Example 2

A spring with a spring constant of $k=400\mathrm{N/m}$ has an uncompressed length of $.23\mathrm{m}$ and a fully compressed length of $.15\mathrm{m}$. What is the force required to fully compress the spring?

We will use the equation$F=kx$ to solve this. We simply have to plug in the known value for the spring and the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") to solve for the force. 

$$
F=kx=(400\mathrm{N/m})(.23\mathrm{m}-.15\mathrm{m})=32\mathrm{N}
$$

Ultimately, many of these “contact” forces are due to attractive and repulsive electromagnetic forces between atoms in materials.

### **Step-by-Step Problem Solving for Newton’s Laws**

#### Step 1

Figure out which object is “of interest.”

1.  If you're looking for the motion of a rolling cart, the cart is the object of interest.
2.  If the object of interest is not moving, that's OK, don't panic yet.
3.  Draw a sketch! This may help you sort out which object is which in your problem.

#### Step 2

Identify all the forces acting on the object and draw them on object. (This is a free-body diagram --FBD)

1.  If the object has mass and is near the Earth, the easiest (and therefore, first) force to write down is the force of gravity, pointing downward, with value _mg_.
2.  If the object is in contact with a flat surface, it means there is a normal force acting on the object. This normal force points away from and is perpendicular to the surface.
3.  There may be more than one normal force acting on an object. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich, remember that the slice of bologna feels normal forces from both the slices of bread!
4.  If a rope, wire, or cord is pulling on the object in question, you've found yourself a tension force. The direction of this force is in the same direction that the rope is pulling.
5.  Don't worry about any forces acting on other objects. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich as your object of interest, and you're thinking about the forces acting on the slice of bologna, don't worry about the force of gravity acting on either piece of bread.
6.  Remember that Newton's $3^{rd}$ Law, calling for “equal and opposite forces,” does not apply to a single object. None of your forces should be “equal and opposite” on the same object in the sense of Newton's $3^{rd}$ Law. Third law pairs act on two different objects.
7.  Recall that scales (like a bathroom scale you weigh yourself on) read out the normal force acting on you, not your [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight"). If you are at rest on the scale, the normal force equals your weight. If you are accelerating up or down, the normal force had better be higher or lower than your weight, or you won’t have an unbalanced force to accelerate you.
8.  Never include “m**a**” as a force acting on an object. “m**a**” is the _result_ of the net force $F_{net}$ which is found by summing all the forces acting on your object of interest.

#### Step 3

Determine how to orient your axes

1.  A good rule to generally follow is that you want one axis (usually the x-axis) to be parallel to the surface your object of interest is sitting on.
2.  If your object is on a ramp, tilt your axes so that the x-axis is parallel to the incline and the y-axis is perpendicular. In this case, this will force you to break the force of gravity on the object into its components. But by tilting your axes, you will generally have to break up fewer [vectors](/c/physics/vectors "vectors"), making the whole problem simpler.

#### Step 4

Identify which forces are in the $x-$ direction, which are in the $y-$ direction, and which are at an angle.

1.  If a force is upward, make it in the $y-$direction and give it a positive sign. If it is downward, make it in the $y-$direction and give it a negative sign.
2.  Same thing applies for right vs. left in the $x-$direction. Make rightward forces positive.
3.  If forces are at an angle, draw them at an angle. A great example is that when a dog on a leash runs ahead, pulling you along, it’s pulling both forward _and_ down on your hand.
4.  Draw the free body diagram (FBD).
5.  Remember that the FBD is supposed to be helping you with your problem. For instance, if you forget a force, it'll be really obvious on your FBD.

#### Step 5

Break the forces that are at angles into their $x$ and $y$ components

1.  Use right triangle trigonometry
2.  Remember that these components aren't _new_ forces, but are just what makes up the forces you've already identified.
3.  Consider making a second FBD to do this component work, so that your first FBD doesn't get too messy.

#### Step 6

Add up all the $x-$forces and $x-$components.

1.  Remember that all the rightward forces add with a plus $(+)$ sign, and that all the leftward forces add with a minus $(-)$ sign.
2.  Don't forget about the $x-$components of any forces that are at an angle!
3.  When you've added them all up, call this "the sum of all $x$ forces" or "the net force in the $x-$direction."

#### Step 7

Add up all the $y-$forces and $y-$components.

1.  Remember that all the upward forces add with a $(+)$ sign, all the downward forces add with a $(-)$ sign.
2.  Don't forget about the $y-$components of any forces that are at an angle!
3.  When you've added them all up, call this "the sum of all $y$ forces" or "net force in the $y-$direction."

#### Step 8

Use Newton's Laws twice.

1.  The sum of all $x-$forces, divided by the mass, is the object's [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") in the $x-$direction.
2.  The sum of all $y-$forces, divided by the mass, is the object's acceleration in the $y-$direction.
3.  If you happen to know that the acceleration in the $x-$direction or $y-$direction is zero (say the object is just sitting on a table), then you can plug this in to Newton’s $2^{nd}$ Law directly.
4.  If you happen to know the acceleration, you can plug this in directly too.

#### Step 9

Each body should have a FBD.

1.  Draw a separate FBD for each body.
2.  Set up a sum of forces equation based on the FBD for each body.
3.  Newton’s Third Law will tell you which forces on different bodies are the same in magnitude.
4.  Your equations should equal your unknown variables at this point.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Using the diagram below, find the net force on the block. The block weighs $3\mathrm{kg}$ and the [inclined plane](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/13.7/primary/lesson/inclined-plane-ms-ps "inclined plane") has a coefficient of [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") of $.6$.

![0](media/54.png "Figure 1: The first step to solving a Newton's Laws problem is to identify the object in question. In our case, the block on the slope is the object of interest.")

Next, we need to draw a free-body diagram. To do this, we need to identify all of the forces acting on the block and their direction. The forces are friction, which acts in the negative x direction, the normal force, which acts in the positive y direction, and gravity, which acts in a combination of the negative y direction and the positive x direction. Notice that we have rotated the picture so that the majority of the forces acting on the block are along the y or x axis. This does not change the answer to the problem because the direction of the forces is still the same relative to each other. When we have determined our answer, we can simply rotate it back to the original position.

Now we need to break down gravity (the only force not along one of the axises) into its component vectors (which do follow the axises). 

$$
\mathrm{The~x~component~of~gravity:}~9.8\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\times cos{60}=4.9\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\\
\mathrm{The~y~component~of~gravity:}~9.8\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\times sin{60}=8.5\mathrm{m/{s^2}}
$$

 Yet these are only the acceleration of gravity so we need to multiply them by the weight of the block to get the force. 

$$
F=ma=3\mathrm{kg}\times 4.9\mathrm{m/{s^2}}=14.7\mathrm{N}
F=ma=3\mathrm{kg}\times 8.5\mathrm{m/{s^2}}=25.5\mathrm{N}
$$

Now that we have solved for the force of the y-component of gravity we know the normal force (they are equal). Therefore the normal force is $25.5 \mathrm{N}$. Now that we have the normal force and the coefficient of static friction, we can find the force of friction. 

$$
F_s=\mu _sF_N=.6\times 25.5\mathrm{N}=15.3\mathrm{N}
$$

The force of static friction is greater than the component of gravity that is forcing the block down the inclined plane. Therefore the force of friction will match the force of the x-component of gravity. So the net force on the block is 

$$
\mathrm{net~force~in~the~x-direction:}~\overbrace{14.7\mathrm{N}}^{x-component~of~gravity}-\overbrace{14.7\mathrm{N}}^{force~of~friction}=0\mathrm{N}\\
\mathrm{net~force~in~the~y-direction:}~\underbrace{25.5\mathrm{N}}_{Normal~Force}-\underbrace{25.5\mathrm{N}}_{y-component~of~gravity}=0\mathrm{N}
$$

 Therefore the net force on the block is $0\mathrm{N}$.

6.  Spinal implant problem — this is a real life bio-med engineering problem! ![0](media/60.png)\[Figure 7\]Here’s the situation: both springs are compressed by an amount $x_o$. The rod of length $L$ is fixed to both the top plate and the bottom plate. The two springs, each with spring constant $k$, are wrapped around the rod on both sides of the middle plate, but are free to move because they are not attached to the rod or the plates. The middle plate has negligible mass, and is constrained in its motion by the compression forces of the top and bottom springs. The medical implementation of this device is to screw the top plate to one vertebrae and the middle plate to the vertebrae directly below. The bottom plate is suspended in space. Instead of fusing broken vertebrates together, this implant allows movement somewhat analogous to the natural movement of functioning vertebrae. Below you will do the exact calculations that an engineer did to get this device patented and available for use at hospitals.
    1.  Find the force, $F$, on the middle plate for the region of its movement $\triangle x \le x_o$. Give your answer in terms of the constants given. (_Hint: In this region both springs are providing opposite compression forces_.)
    2.  Find the force, $F$, on the middle plate for the region of its movement $\triangle x \ge x_o$. Give your answer in terms of the constants given. (_Hint: In this region, only one spring is in contact with the middle plate._)
    3.  Graph $F$ vs. $x$. Label the values for force for the transition region in terms of the constants given.
7.  You design a mechanism for lifting boxes up an inclined plane by using a vertically hanging mass to pull them, as shown in the figure below. ![0](media/61.png)\[Figure 8\]The pulley at the top of the incline is massless and frictionless. The larger mass, $M$, is accelerating downward with a measured acceleration a. The smaller masses are $m_A$ and $m_B$ ; the angle of the incline is $\theta$, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between each of the masses and the incline has been measured and determined to be $\mu_K$.
    1.  Draw free body diagrams for each of the three masses.
    2.  Calculate the magnitude of the frictional force on each of the smaller masses in terms of the given quantities.
    3.  Calculate the net force on the hanging mass in terms of the given quantities.
    4.  Calculate the magnitudes of the two tension forces $T_A$ and $T_B$ in terms of the given quantities.
    5.  Design and state a strategy for solving for how long it will take the larger mass to hit the ground, assuming at this moment it is at a height $h$ above the ground. Do not attempt to solve this: simply state the strategy for solving it.
8.  You build a device for lifting objects, as shown below. A rope is attached to the ceiling and two masses are allowed to hang from it. The end of the rope passes around a pulley (right) where you can pull it downward to lift the two objects upward. The angles of the ropes, measured with respect to the vertical, are shown. Assume the bodies are at rest initially. ![0](media/62.png)\[Figure 9\]
    
    1.  Suppose you are able to measure the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ of the two hanging objects as well as the tension $T_C$. Do you then have enough information to determine the other two tensions, $T_A$ and $T_B$? Explain your reasoning.
    2.  If you only knew the tensions $T_A$ and $T_C$, would you have enough information to determine the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$? If so, write $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of $T_A$ and $T_C$. If not, what further information would you require?

9.  A stunt driver is approaching a cliff at very high speed. Sensors in his car have measured the acceleration and velocity of the car, as well as all forces acting on it, for various times. The driver’s motion can be broken down into the following steps: Step 1: The driver, beginning at rest, accelerates his car on a horizontal road for ten seconds. Sensors show that there is a force in the direction of motion of $6000\;\mathrm{N}$, but additional forces acting in the opposite direction with magnitude $1000 \;\mathrm{N}$. The mass of the car is $1250 \;\mathrm{kg}$. Step 2: Approaching the cliff, the driver takes his foot off of the gas pedal (There is no further force in the direction of motion.) and brakes, increasing the force opposing motion from $1000 \;\mathrm{N}$ to $2500 \;\mathrm{N}$. This continues for five seconds until he reaches the cliff. Step 3: The driver flies off the cliff, which is $44.1 \;\mathrm{m}$ high and begins projectile motion.
    1.  Ignoring air resistance, how long is the stunt driver in the air?
    2.  For Step 1:
        1.  Draw a free body diagram, naming all the forces on the car.
        2.  Calculate the magnitude of the net force.
        3.  Find the change in velocity over the stated time period.
        4.  Make a graph of velocity in the $x-$direction vs. time over the stated time period.
        5.  Calculate the distance the driver covered in the stated time period. Do this by finding the area under the curve in your graph of (iv). Then, check your result by using the equations for kinematics.
    3.  Repeat (b) for Step 2.
    4.  Calculate the distance that the stunt driver should land from the bottom of the cliff.

## 5.0 Centripetal Forces

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/64.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

In the absence of a net force, objects move in a straight line. If they turn — that is, if their velocity changes, _even only in direction_ — there must be an applied force. Forces which cause objects to turn around continuously in a circle are known as _centripetal_ forces. When an object moves in a circle its velocity at any particular instant points in a direction _tangent_ to the circle. The acceleration points towards the center of the circle, and so does the force acting on it. This is only natural, when you think about it — if you feel a force pushing you towards your left as you walk forward, you will walk in a circle, always turning left.

### 5.1 Circular Motion

<article>

 

In circular motion there is always an [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") (and hence a force) that points to the center of the circle defined by the objects motion. This force changes the direction of the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") vector of the object but not the [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed"). You can calculate that speed using the period of motion and the length of its path (circumference of the circle it traces out).

### 5.2 Angular Speed

<article>

 

When something rotates in a circle, it moves through a _position angle_ $\theta$ that runs from $0$ to $2\pi$ radians and starts over again at $0$. The physical [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") it moves is called the _path length._ If the radius of the circle is larger, the path length traveled is longer. According to the arc length formula $s = r\theta$, the path length $\Delta s$ traveled by something at radius $r$ through an angle $\theta$ is:

$$
\Delta s = r \Delta \theta  \text{ [1]}
$$

Just like the linear [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") is the rate of change of distance, angular velocity, usually called $\omega$, is the rate of change of $\theta$. The direction of angular velocity is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Analogously, the rate of change of $\omega$ is the angular [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") $\alpha$. 

For an object moving in a circle, the objects tangential [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") is directly proportional to the distance it is from the rotation axis. the tangential speed (as shown in the key equations) equals this distance multiplied by the angular speed (in radians/sec).

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $\omega = 2\pi / T = 2\pi f$ ; Relationship between period and angular frequency.
> 
> $\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta s}{rt}= \frac{v}{r}$
> 
> $v = \omega r$

#### Example

A Merry Go Round is rotating once every 4 seconds. If you are on a horse that is 15 m from the rotation axis, how fast are you moving (i.e. what is your tangential speed)?

$v = r \omega$

Now we need to convert the angular speed to units of radians per second.

$$
\omega = \frac{1}{4} \frac{\cancel{rotations} }{second} * \frac{2 \pi}{1} \frac{radians}{\cancel{rotation}} 
= \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{radians}{second}
$$

$v = 15 m \times \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac {15}{2} \pi \approx 23.6 \frac{radians}{second}$

### 5.3 Centripetal Acceleration

<article>

 

If a mass $m$ is traveling with [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") $\vec{v}$  and experiences a centripetal --- always perpendicular --- force $\vec{F_c}$, it will travel in a circle of radius

$$
r = \frac{m v^2}{|\vec{F}|}\text{ [1]}
$$

Alternatively, to keep this mass moving at this velocity in a circle of this radius, one needs to apply a [centripetal force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/5.2/primary/lesson/centripetal-force-phys "centripetal force") of

$$
\vec{F_c} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \text{ [2]}
$$

By [Newton's Second Law](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.3/primary/lesson/newtons-second-law-ms-ps "Newton's Second Law"), this is equivalent to a centripetal acceleration of  

$$
\vec{F_c} =\cancel{m}\vec{a_c} = \cancel{m}\frac{v^2}{r} \text{ [3]}
$$ 

> ### Key Equations

#### Example

If you are 4m from the center of a Merry-Go-Round that is rotating at 1 revolution every 2 seconds, what is your centripetal acceleration?

First, we need to find your tangential velocity. We can do this using the given angular velocity.

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega&=\frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{2\text{ s}}\\
\omega&=\pi\text{ rad/s}\\
\omega&=\frac{v}{r}\\
v&=\omega r\\
v&=\pi\;\text{rad/s}*4\;\text{m}\\
v&=4\pi\;\text{m/s}
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can find your centripetal acceleration using the radius of your rotation.

$$
\begin{align*}
a_c&=\frac{v^2}{r}\\
a_c&=\frac{(4\pi\;\text{m/s})^2}{4\;\text{m}}\\
a_c&=4\pi^2\;\text{m/s}^2\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 5.4 Centripetal Force Problems

<article>

 

Any force can be a centripetal force. Centripetal force is the umbrella term given to any force that is acting perpendicular to the motion of an object and thus causing it to go in a circle. Keep the following in mind when solving centripetal force type problems:

* The [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of the object remains constant. The centripetal force is changing the direction but not the speed of the object.
* Although the object 'feels' an outward pull, this is not a true force, but merely the objects [inertia](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.2/primary/lesson/inertia-ms-ps "inertia"). Remember, [Newton's first law](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.1/primary/lesson/newtons-first-law-ms-ps "Newton's first law") maintains that the natural state of an object is to go in a straight line at constant speed. Thus, when you make a right turn in your car and the basketball in the back seat flies to the left, that is because the car is moving right and the basketball is maintaining it's position and thus from your point of view moves to the left. Your point of view in this case is different from reality because you are in a rotating reference frame.

#### Applications

* To find the maximum speed that a car can take a corner on a flat road without skidding out, set the force of [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") equal to the centripetal force.

* To find the tension in the rope of a swinging [pendulum](/c/physics/pendulum "pendulum"), remember that it is the _sum_ of the tension and gravity that produces a net upward centripetal force. A common mistake is just setting the centripetal force equal to the tension.

* To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, set the force of gravity equal to the centripetal force.

* Banked turns (the road is not flat, but rather at an angle) allow for a greater speed before skidding out. In this case the normal force aids the force of friction in creating a larger centripetal force than that which can be obtained by friction alone on a flat road. It’s not as simple as adding them together, one must consider the components of these two forces in the direction to the center of the circle.

Introduction

![0](media/71.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

Over 2500 years ago Aristotle proposed two laws of physics governing motion. One for ‘Earthly bodies’ (objects on Earth) that states objects naturally go in straight lines and one for ‘Heavenly bodies’ (objects in space) that states objects naturally go in circles. This idea held steady for 2,000 years until Isaac Newton, in a triumph of brilliance, declared that there is one law of physics that governs motion and he unified “earthly” bodies and “heavenly” bodies with the The Universal Law of Gravitation. Newton used the universal law of gravity to prove that the moon is accelerating towards Earth just as a body on Earth is falling towards it. The acceleration of both the moon and the object on Earth is calculated using the same formula. This theory is so well regarded that it has been used to hypothesize the existence of black holes and dark matter, later verified by observation. The search to unify the laws of physics into one theory continues today and is often referred to as the yet undiscovered Grand Unified Theory (GUT).

* The direction of the force of gravity is in a straight line between two objects. It is always attractive.
* Newton invented calculus in order to prove that for a spherical object (like Earth) one can assume all of its mass is at the center of the sphere (thus in his formula, one can use the radius of Earth for the distance between a falling rock and Earth).
* Newton's Laws apply to all forces; but when he developed them only one was known: gravity. Newton's major insight --- and one of the greatest in the history of science --- was that the same force that causes objects to fall when released is also responsible for keeping the planets in orbit.

#### Universal Gravity

Any two objects in the universe, with masses and with their centers of mass at a distance apart will experience a force of mutual attraction along the line joining their centers of mass equal to:

where G is the Gravitational constant:



Here is an illustration of this law for two objects, for instance the earth and the sun:

![0](media/72.png)

#### Gravity on the Earth's Surface

On the surface of a planet --- such as earth --- the in formula \[3. is very close to the radius of the planet, since a planet's center of mass is --- usually --- at its center. It also does not vary by much: for instance, the earth's radius is about 6,000 km, while the heights we consider for this book are on the order of at most a few kilometers --- so we can say that for objects near the surface of the earth, the in formula \[3. is constant and equal to the earth's radius. This allows us to say that gravity is more or less constant on the surface of the earth. Here's an illustration:

![0](media/73.png)

For any object a height above the surface of the earth, the force of gravity may be expressed as:

We can do this because the quantity in braces only has constants; we can combine them and call their product . Remember, _this is an approximation that holds_ **_only_** _when the in formula \[3. is more or less constant._

We call the quantity an object's **[weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight")**. Unlike an object's mass, an object's weight can change and depends on the gravitational force it experiences. In fact, an object's weight is the magnitude of the gravitational force on it. To find the weight of an object on another planet, star, or moon, use the appropriate values in the formula for the force of gravity.

### Review

1.  Which is greater – the gravitational force that the Sun exerts on the moon, or the force the Earth exerts on the moon? Does the moon orbit the Earth or the Sun? Explain.
2.  Use Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation to explain why even though Jupiter has 300 times the mass of the earth, on the “surface” of Jupiter you’d weigh only 3 times what you weigh on earth. What other factor has to be considered here?
3.  Prove is _approximately_ on Earth by following these steps:
    1.  Calculate the force of gravity between a falling object (for example an apple) and that of Earth. Use the symbol to represent the mass of the falling object.
    2.  Now divide that force by the object’s mass to find the acceleration of the object.
    3.  Calculate the force of gravity between the Sun and the Earth. (sun mass average distance from sun to earth = 150 million km)
4.  Calculate the gravitational force that your pencil or pen pulls on you. Use the center of your chest as the center of mass (and thus the mark for the distance measurement) and estimate all masses and distances.
    1.  If there were no other forces present, what would your acceleration be towards your pencil? Is this a large or small acceleration?
    2.  Why, in fact, doesn’t your pencil accelerate towards you?
5.  Mo and Jo have been traveling through the galaxy for eons when they arrive at the planet Remulak. Wanting to measure the gravitational field strength of the planet they drop Mo’s lava lamp from the top deck of their spacecraft, collecting the velocity-time data shown below.

| **velocity (m/s)** | **time (s)** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |
| 3.4 | 1.0 |
| 7.0 | 2.0 |
| 9.8 | 3.0 |
| 14.0 | 4.0 |
| 17.1 | 5.0 |

(a) Plot a velocity-time graph using the axes above. Put numbers, labels and units on your axes. Then draw a best-fit line (use a ruler) and use that line to find the gravitational field strength of Remulak. Explain below how you did that.

![0](media/74.png)

(b) Mo and Jo go exploring and drop a rock into a deep canyon – it hits the ground in 8.4 s. How deep is the canyon?

(c) If the rock has a mass of 25 g and makes a hole in the ground 1.3 cm deep, what force does the ground exert to bring it to a stop?

(d) Mo and Jo observe the shadows of their lava lamps at different positions on the planet and determine (a la Eratosthenes, the Greek astronomer, around 200 B.C.) that the radius of Remulak is 4500 km. Use that and your result for to find the mass of Remulak.

### 6.2 Gravity and Space Problems

<article>

 

### When Can Gravity Act as a Centripetal Force?

We saw in the Centripetal Forces chapter that the force of Gravity causes an attraction between two objects of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ at a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") $r$ of 

$$
\vec{F_G} = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}. \text{ [4]}
$$

 By [Newton's Third Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.4/primary/lesson/newton%e2%80%99s-third-law-of-motion-phys "Newton's Third Law"), both objects experience the force: equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, and both will move as an effect of it. If one of the objects is much lighter than the other (like the earth is to the sun, or a satellite is to earth) we can approximate the situation by saying that the heavier mass (the sun) does not move, since its [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") will be far smaller due to its large mass. Then, if the lighter mass remains at a relatively constant absolute distance from the heavier one (remember, [centripetal force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/5.2/primary/lesson/centripetal-force-phys "centripetal force") needs to be constant in magnitude), we can say that the lighter mass experiences an _effectively_ centripetal force and thus has a [centripetal acceleration](/c/physics/centripetal-acceleration "centripetal acceleration").

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$
> 
> for a particle travels a distance $2\pi r$ in an amount of time _$T$_
> 
> $\vec{F_G} = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}$
>

#### Math of Centripetal Gravity

Gravity is not always a centripetal force. This is a really important point. It only acts as a centripetal force when conditions approximate those listed above --- very much like it isn't constant near the surface of the earth, but very close to it.

If gravity provides centripetal force and acceleration, we can set \[2. equal to \[4\]. It's important to remember that in \[2. $m$ refers to the lighter mass, since that is the one traveling. Then, 

$$
\frac{G\cancel{m_1}m_2}{\cancelto{r}{r^2}} = \frac{\cancel{m_1}v^2}{\cancel{r}}
$$

So, the relationship between [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") and radius for a circular orbit of a light object around an heavy mass (note the mass of the lighter object cancels) is:

$$
Gm_2 = {v_{\text{orb}}}^2 r_{\text{orb}}
$$

 

#### Geosynchronous Orbit

This is the orbit where a satellite completes one orbit of the Earth every 24 hours, staying above the same spot (longitude) on Earth. This is a very important orbit for spy satellites and TV satellites among others. You force the [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of the satellite to be a value such that the satellite makes one rotation every 24 hours.

1.  A digital TV satellite is placed in geosynchronous orbit around Earth, so it is always in the same spot in the sky.
    1.  Using the fact that the satellite will have the same period of revolution as Earth, calculate the radius of its orbit.
    2.  What is the ratio of the radius of this orbit to the radius of the Earth?
    3.  Draw a sketch, to scale, of the Earth and the orbit of this digital TV satellite.
    4.  If the mass of the satellite were to double, would the radius of the satellite’s orbit be larger, smaller, or the same? Why?
2.  A top secret spy satellite is designed to orbit the Earth twice each day (_i.e.,_ twice as fast as the Earth’s rotation). What is the height of this orbit above the Earth’s surface?
3.  Two stars with masses $3.00\times10^{31} \;\mathrm{kg}$ and $7.00\times10^{30} \;\mathrm{kg}$ are orbiting each other under the influence of each other’s gravity. We want to send a satellite in between them to study their behavior. However, the satellite needs to be at a point where the gravitational forces from the two stars are equal. The distance between the two stars is $2.0\times10^{10} \;\mathrm{m}$. Find the distance from the more massive star to where the satellite should be placed. (_Hint:_ Distance from the satellite to one of the stars is the variable.)
4.  Calculate the mass of the Earth using _only: (i)_ Newton’s Universal Law of Gravity; _(ii)_ the Moon-Earth distance (3.85 x 10_8_ m); and _(iii)_ the fact that it takes the Moon 27 days to orbit the Earth.

## 7.0 Momentum Conservation

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/77.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe is constant. This law only makes sense if we measure “motion” in a specific way: as the product of mass and velocity. This product, called _momentum,_ can be transferred from one object to another in a collision. The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by the forces involved in the collision. This is the second of the five fundamental conservation laws in physics. The other four are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge, and CPT. (See Feynman's Diagrams for an explanation of CPT.)



</article>

### 7.1 Momentum

<article>

Momentum is a vector that points in the direction of the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") vector. The magnitude of this vector is the product of mass and [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed"). The total momentum of the universe is always the same and is equal to zero. The total momentum of an isolated system never changes. Momentum can be transferred from one body to another. In an isolated system in which momentum is transferred internally, the total initial momentum is the same as the total final momentum. Momentum conservation is especially important in collisions, where the total momentum just before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision.

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> $p=mv$ Momentum is equal to the object's mass multiplied by its velocity
> 
> $\sum p_{\text{initial}} = \sum p_{\text{final}}$ The total momentum does not change in closed systems

### Examples

#### Example 1

A truck with mass 500 kg and originally carrying 200 kg of dirt is rolling forward with the transmission in neutral and shooting out the dirt backwards at 2 m/s (so that the dirt is at relative speed of zero compared with the ground). If the truck is originally moving at 2 m/s, how fast will it be moving after it has shot out all the dirt. You may ignore the effects of [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction").

To solve this problem we will apply [conservation of momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.8/primary/lesson/law-of-conservation-of-momentum-ms-ps "conservation of momentum") to the truck when it is full of dirt and when it has dumped all the dirt.

$$
\begin{align*}
m_iv_i&=m_fv_f && \text{initial momentum is equal to final momentum}\\
(m_t+m_d)v_i&=m_tv_f && \text{substitute the mass of the truck plus the mass}\\
&  && \text{of the dirt in the truck at initial and final states}\\
v_f&=\frac{(m_t+m_d)v_i}{m_t} && \text{solve for the final velocity}\\
v_f&=\frac{(500\;\text{kg} + 200\;\text{kg})*2\;\text{m/s}}{500\;\text{kg}} && \text{plug in the numerical values}\\
v_f&=2.8\;\text{m/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 2

John and Bob are standing at rest in middle of a frozen lake so there is no friction between their feet and the ice. Both of them want to get to shore so they simultaneously push off each other in opposite directions. If John's mass is 50 kg and Bob's mass is 40 kg and John moving at 5 m/s after pushing off Bob, how fast is Bob moving?

For this problem, we will apply conservation of momentum to the whole system that includes both John and Bob. Since both of them are at rest to start, we know that the total momentum of the whole system must always be zero. Therefore, we know that the sum of John's and Bob's momentum after they push off each other is also zero. We can use this to solve for Bob's velocity.

$$
\begin{align*}
0&=m_jv_j+m_bv_b\\
-m_bv_b&=m_jv_j\\
v_b&=-\frac{m_jv_j}{m_b}\\
v_b&=-\frac{50\;\text{kg}*5\;\text{m/s}}{40\;\text{kg}}\\
v_b&=-6.25\;\text{m/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

The answer is negative because Bob is traveling in the opposite direction to John.

### 7.2 Impulse

<article>

 

The force imparted on an object is equal to the change in [momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.7/primary/lesson/momentum-ms-ps "momentum") divided by the time interval over which the objects are in contact. 

**Internal forces** are forces for which both Newton’s Third Law force pairs are contained within the system. For example, consider a two-car head-on collision. Define the _system_ as just the two cars. In this case, internal forces include that of the fenders pushing on each other, the contact forces between the bolts, washers, and nuts in the engines, etc. 

**External forces** are forces that act on the system from outside. In our previous example, external forces include the force of gravity acting on both cars (because the other part of the force pair, the pull of gravity the Earth experiences coming from the cars, is not included in the system) and the forces of [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") between the tires and the road. If there are no external forces acting on a system of objects, the initial momentum of the system will be the same as the final momentum of the system. Otherwise, the final momentum will change by $\Delta \vec{p} = \vec{F}\Delta t$. We call such a change in momentum $\Delta \vec{p}$  an **impulse**.

### 7.3 Elastic Collisions

<article>

An elastic collision is a collision where both [momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.7/primary/lesson/momentum-ms-ps "momentum") and [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") are conserved. The only true case of elastic collisions are in particle physics. However, pool balls, bumper cars, etc. loose very little of their kinetic energy during the collision and approximate an elastic collision. These types of collisions are used as elastic collision problems. In elastic collisions the objects can not stick together (this would suck kinetic energy out of the system) and one can use [conservation of momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.8/primary/lesson/law-of-conservation-of-momentum-ms-ps "conservation of momentum") and [conservation of energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.7/primary/lesson/conservation-of-energy-phys "conservation of energy") to solve the problem.

#### Example 

Chris and Ashley are playing pool. Ashley hits the cue ball into the $8$ ball with a [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of $2.0\mathrm{m/s}$. The cue ball $(c)$ and the $8$ ball ($e$) react as shown in the diagram. The $8$ ball and the cue ball both have a mass of $.17\mathrm{kg}$. What is the velocity of the cue ball? What is the direction (the angle) of the cue ball?

We know the equation for conservation of momentum, along with the masses of the objects in question as well two of the three velocities. Therefore all we need to do is manipulate the conservation of momentum equation so that it is solved for the velocity of the cue ball after the collision and then plug in the known values to get the velocity of the cue ball.

$$
\begin{align*}
m_{c}v_{ic}+m_{e}v_{ie}&=m_{c}v_{fc}+m_{e}v_{fe}\\
v_{fc}&=\frac{m_{c}v_{ic}+m_{e}v_{ie}-m_{e}v_{fe}}{m_{c}}\\
v_{fc}&=\frac{.17\mathrm{kg}\times 2.0\mathrm{m/s}+.17\mathrm{kg}\times 0\mathrm{m/s}-.17\mathrm{kg}\times 1.2\mathrm{m/s}}{.17\mathrm{kg}}\\
v_{fc}&=.80\mathrm{m/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we want to find the direction of the cue ball. To do this we will use the diagram below.

![0](media/81.png)\[Figure 1\]

We know that the momentum in the y direction of the two balls is equal. Therefore we can say that the velocity in the y direction is also equal because the masses of the two balls are equal. 

$$
m_cv_cy=m_ev_ey \rightarrow v_cy=v_ey
$$

Given this and the diagram, we can find the direction of the cue ball. After 1 second, the $8$ ball will have traveled $1.2\mathrm{m}$. Therefore we can find the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") it has traveled in the y direction. 

$$
sin25^o=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}=\frac{x}{1.2\mathrm{m}} \rightarrow x=sin25\times 1.2\mathrm{m}=.51\mathrm{m}
$$

 Therefore, in one second the cue ball will have traveled $.51\mathrm{m}$ in the y direction as well. We also know how far in total the cue ball travels in one second $(.80\mathrm{m})$. Thus we can find the direction of the cue ball. 

$$
sin^{-1}\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}=sin^{-1}\frac{.51\mathrm{m}}{.80\mathrm{m}}=40^o
$$

### Review

1.  You are playing pool and you hit the cue ball with a speed of 2 m/s at the 8-ball (which is stationary). Assume an elastic collision and that both balls are the same mass. Find the speed and direction of both balls after the collision, assuming neither flies off at any angle.
2.  A 0.045 kg golf ball with a speed of 42.0 m/s collides elastically head-on with a 0.17 kg pool ball at rest. Find the speed and direction of both balls after the collision.
3.  Ball A is traveling along a flat table with a speed of 5.0 m/s, as shown below. Ball B, which has the same mass, is initially at rest, but is knocked off the table (1.5m in height) in an elastic collision with Ball A. Find the horizontal distance that Ball B travels before hitting the floor.![0](media/82.png)\[Figure 2\]
4.  Students are doing an experiment on the lab table. A steel ball is rolled down a small ramp and allowed to hit the floor. Its impact point is carefully marked. Next a second ball of the same mass is put upon a set screw and a collision takes place such that both balls go off at an angle and hit the floor. All measurements are taken with a meter stick on the floor with a co-ordinate system such that just below the impact point is the origin. The following data is collected:
    1.  no collision: $41.2 \;\mathrm{cm}$
    2.  target ball: $37.3 \;\mathrm{cm}$ in the direction of motion and $14.1 \;\mathrm{cm}$ perpendicular to the direction of motion![0](media/83.png)\[Figure 3\]
        1.  From this data predict the impact position of the other ball.
        2.  One of the lab groups declares that the data on the floor alone demonstrate to a $2$% accuracy that the collision was elastic. Show their reasoning.
        3.  Another lab group says they can’t make that determination without knowing the velocity the balls have on impact. They ask for a timer. The instructor says you don’t need one; use your meter stick. Explain.
        4.  Design an experiment to prove momentum conservation with balls of different masses, giving apparatus, procedure and design. Give some sample numbers.
5.  A 3 kg ball is moving 2 m/s in the positive $x-$direction when it is struck dead center by a 2 kg ball moving in the positive $y-$direction at 1 m/s. After collision the 3 kg ball moves at 1 m/s 130 degrees from the positive $x-$axis.![0](media/84.png)\[Figure 4\]Find the velocity and direction of the 2 kg ball.

### 7.4 Inelastic Collisions

<article>

In an inelastic collision, [momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.7/primary/lesson/momentum-ms-ps "momentum") is conserved within the system but [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") is not; [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") from the collision is turned into other forms besides kinetic energy. For example, some of the kinetic energy goes into producing [heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "heat") and deforming the objects.You can find the change in kinetic energy by calculating the kinetic energy of all the objects before and after the collision, but you must first use [conservation of momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.8/primary/lesson/law-of-conservation-of-momentum-ms-ps "conservation of momentum") to solve for the unknown values.

In a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects will stick together and combine into a single mass. This means that when you calculate the final momentum of the system, you should consider there to be only one object with a larger total mass. Remember, you can only use conservation of momentum to solve a problem involving an inelastic collision

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $\sum p_{\text{initial}} = \sum p_{\text{final}}$ The total momentum does not change in closed systems

#### Example

Two blocks collide on a frictionless surface. Afterwards, they have a combined mass of 10kg and a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of $2.5\mathrm{m/s}$. Before the collision, block A, which has a mass of 8.0kg, was at rest. What was the mass and initial speed of block B?

![0](media/85.png "Figure 1: To find mass of block B we have a simple subtraction problem. We know that the combined mass is 10kg and the mass of block A is 8.0kg. ")

$$
10\mathrm{kg}-8.0\mathrm{kg}=2.0\mathrm{kg}
$$

Now that we know the mass of both blocks we can find the speed of block B. We will use conservation of momentum. This was a completely inelastic collision. We know this because the blocks stuck together after the collision. This problem is one dimensional, because all motion happens along the same line. Thus we will use the equation 

$$
(m_A+m_B)v_f=m_A\times v_A+m_B\times v_B
$$

 and solve for the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of block B. 

$$
(m_A+m_B)v_f=m_A\times v_A+m_Bv_B \Rightarrow \frac{(m_A+m_B)(v_f)-(m_A)(v_A)}{m_B}=v_B
$$

## 8.0 Energy Conservation

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/89.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

The law of _conservation of momentum_ states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of momentum is constant. Momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but none is lost or gained. If a system has its momentum changed from the outside it is caused by an _impulse,_ which transfers momentum from one body to another.

When any two bodies in the universe interact, they can exchange energy, momentum, or both. The law of _conservation of energy_ states that in any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of energy remains fixed. Energy is transferred from one form to another, but not lost or gained. If energy is put into a system from the outside or vice versa it is often in the form of _work,_ which is a transfer of energy between bodies.

### 8.2 Kinetic Energy

The [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") of motion is kinetic energy, KE. Whenever an object is in motion it has kinetic energy. The faster it is going, the more energy it has.

#### Example

You are using a sling to throw a small stone. If the sling is .5 m long and you are spinning it at 15 rad/s, how high would the rock go if you throw it straight up?

We'll start by setting the kinetic energy of rock to it's gravitational [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy") at it's maximum height and then solving for the rock's height.

### 8.3 Conservation of Energy

<article>

 

[Energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "Energy") is conserved in a closed system. That is, if you add up all the energy of an object(s) at one time it will equal all the energy of said object(s) at a later time. A closed system is a system where no energy is transferred in or out. The total energy of the universe is a constant (i.e. it does not change). The problems below do not consider the situation of energy transfer (called work). So [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") and other sources where energy leaves the system are not present. Thus, one simply adds up all the [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy") and [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") _before_ and sets it equal to the addition of the total potential energy and kinetic energy _after_.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $\sum E_{\text{initial}} = \sum E_{\text{final}}$ The total energy does not change in closed systems

#### Example

Billy is standing at the bottom of a ramp inclined at 30 degrees. Billy slides a 2 kg puck up the ramp with an initial [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of 4 m/s. How far up the ramp does the ball travel before it begins to roll back down? Ignore the effects of friction.

The potential energy of the puck when it stops at the top of it's path will be equal to the kinetic energy that it was initially rolled with. We can use this to determine the how high above the ground the puck will be above the ground when it stops, and then use trigonometry to find out how far up the ramp the puck will be when it stops.

$$
\begin{align*}
PE_i + KE_i &= PE_f + KE_f && \text{start with conservation of energy}\\
0 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 &= mgh + 0 && \text{take out the energy terms we know will be zero and substitute}\\
& && \text{the equations for potential and kinetic energy}\\
\frac{1}{2}v^2 &= gh && \text{simplify the equation}\\
h&=\frac{v^2}{2g} && \text{solve for }h\\
h&=\frac{(4\;\text{m/s})^2}{2*9.8\;\text{m/s}^2} && \text{substitute in the known values}\\
h&=0.82\;\text{m}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can find the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") up the ramp the ball traveled since we know the angle of the ramp and the height of the ball above the ground.

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin(30)&=\frac{h}{x}\\
x&=\frac{h}{\sin(30)}\\
x&=\frac{0.82\;\text{m}}{\sin(30)}\\
x&=1.6\;\text{m}\\

### 8.4 Work

<article>

> $W = F_{x} \Delta x = Fd \ \cos \circleddash$ Work is equal to the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") an object moves multiplied by the component of the force in the direction that object is moving.

> $W=$ work (in Joules) is [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") being transferred

When an object moves in the direction of an applied force, we say that the force does **work** on the object. Note that the force may be slowing the object down, speeding it up, maintaining its [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") --- any number of things. In all cases, the net work done is given by this formula:

$$
\begin{align*}
W = \vec{F}\cdot \vec{d} = \vec{F}\cdot \Delta \vec{x} &&  \text {Work is the dot product of force and displacement.}
\end{align*}
$$

In other words, if an object has traveled a distance $d$ under force $\vec{F}$ , the work done on it will equal to $d$ multiplied by the component of $\vec{F}$  along the object's path. Consider the following example of a block moving horizontally with a force applied at some angle:

![0](media/92.png "Figure 1: Here the net work done on the object by the force will be $F d \cos \theta$.")

### Examples

#### Example 1

A 1kg ball has been attached to a 2m string and is at rest on a frictionless surface. If you exert a constant force of 10N on the string and pull the ball over the course of 5m and then begin spinning the ball in a circle, after 3 revolutions, what is the total amount of work you have done on the ball?

Since the [centripetal force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/5.2/primary/lesson/centripetal-force-phys "centripetal force") you exert on the ball in order to make it spin is perpendicular to the ball's path, you do not work on the ball while spinning it in a circle. Therefore, the only work you do on the ball is when you are pulling it in a straight line.

$$
\begin{align*}
W&=Fd\\
W&=10\text{N} * 5\text{m}\\
W&=50\text{J}\\
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 2

A block of mass 5kg is sliding down a ramp inclined at 45 degrees. If the coefficient of kinetic [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") between the ramp and the block is 0.3, how much work does the force of friction do as the block slides 3m down to the bottom of the ramp.

In order to find the work done by friction, we first want to find out the magnitude of the force of friction.

$$
\begin{align*}
f&=\mu_kN && \text{start with the equation for the force of friction}\\
f&=\mu_kmg\cos(30) && \text{substitute the y-component of the weight of the block for the normal force}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now that we have the magnitude of the force of friction, we can plug that into the equation for work.

$$
\begin{align*}
W&=Fd\\
W&=\mu_kmgcos(45)\\
W&=0.3*5\text{kg}*9.8\text{m/s}^2*\cos(45)\\
W&=10.4J
\end{align*}
$$

### 8.5 Energy Problem Solving

<article>

 

The main thing to always keep prescient in your mind is that the total [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") before must equal the total energy after. If some energy has transferred out of or into the system via work, you calculate that work done and include it in the energy sum equation. Generally work done by [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") is listed on the 'after' side and work put into the system, via a jet pack for example, goes on the 'before' side. Another important point is that on turns or going over hills or in rollercoaster loops, one must include the centripetal motion equations -for example to insure that you have enough [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") to make the loop.

### 8.6 Energy and Momentum Problems

<article>

When attacking these problems remember that in a collision, [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") is transferred out of the system to the environment, via [heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "heat"), sound, breaking of molecular bonds, etc. Thus this is not a closed system during a collision of two objects. Thus you cannot use [energy conservation](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.7/primary/lesson/conservation-of-energy-phys "energy conservation") immediately before the collision to immediately after the collision. However, [momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.7/primary/lesson/momentum-ms-ps "momentum") is conserved during the collision. Thus break the problem into two parts. For the collision part use momentum conservation. You can use energy conservation for the other parts, where it is conserved.

### 8.7 Power and Efficiency

<article>

 

Power is the rate at which [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") is being transferred. Power tells you how many Joules per second of energy is being used to drive something. Thus power is simply the change in energy divided by the time. Since work is by definition the transfer of energy (in or out of a system), power is also equal to the work divided by the time. Efficiency tells you how efficient something is and gives a number between 0 and 1. If the efficiency is equal to 1, then the [machine](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/7.2/primary/lesson/simple-machines-phys "machine") is perfectly efficient (that is all the power used to drive it goes to the out put of the machine with no energy losses). If the efficiency is zero, then all of the input power is lost in the machine and the machine can not output any energy.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $P = \frac{W} {\Delta t}$ Power is equal to the energy released per second and has units of Watts (1 Watt = J/s)
> 
> $\text{Eff} = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$ The efficiency equals the output power divided by the input power

#### Example

![0](media/104.png "Figure 1: A pile driver lifts a 500 kg mass a vertical [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") of 20 m in 1.1 sec. It uses 225 kW of supplied power to do this.")

a) How much work was done by the pile driver?



We will use the equation for work (which gives us the amount of energy transferred) and plug in the known values to get the amount of work done by the pile driver. 

$$
W=Fd=mgd=500\mathrm{kg}\times 9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}\times 20\mathrm{m}=9.8\times 10^4\mathrm{J}
$$

b) How much power was used in actually lifting the mass?



We will use the power equation and plug in the known values and then convert to kW at the end. 

$$
P=\frac{W}{\Delta t}=\frac{9.8\times 10^4\mathrm{J}}{1.1\mathrm{s}}=89000\mathrm{W} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{kW}}{1000\mathrm{W}}=89\mathrm{kW}
$$

c) What is the efficiency of the machine? (This is the ratio of power used to power supplied.)

Efficiency is defined as the Power out divided by the Power in. Thus, this is simply a division problem. 

$$
Eff = \frac{\mathrm{power~used}}{\mathrm{power~supplied}}=\frac{89\mathrm{kW}}{225\mathrm{kW}}=.40
$$

d) The mass is dropped on a pile and falls 20 m. If it loses 40,000 J on the way down to the ground due to air [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance"), what is its [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") when it hits the pile?

We have already solved for the amount of energy the mass has after the pile driver performs work on it (it has $9.8\times 10^4\mathrm{J}$). If on the way down it loses $40000\mathrm{J}$ due to air resistance, then it effectively has 

$$
98000\mathrm{J}-40000\mathrm{J}=58000\mathrm{J}
$$

 of energy. So we will set the [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") equation equal to the total energy and solve for v. This will give us the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of the mass when it hits the ground because right before the mass hits the ground, all of the [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy") will have been converted into kinetic energy. 

$$
58000\mathrm{J}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \Rightarrow v=\sqrt{\frac{58000\mathrm{J}\times 2}{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{58000\mathrm{J}\times 2}{500\mathrm{kg}}}=15.2\mathrm{m/s}
$$

    1.  550,000 Joules of binding energy are wasted during digestion. How much remains?

### 8.8 Mechanical Advantage

<article>

 

Mechanical Advantage is the ability to lift or move objects with great force while utilizing only a little force. The trade-off is that you must operate the smaller input force for a large [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance"). This is all seen through the work Equation. Work equals force times distance. [Energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "Energy") is conserved. Thus one can get a large force for a small distance equal to a small force for a large distance.Mechanical advantage equals the distance of effort divided by the distance the object moves. It is also equal to the output force divided by the input force.

> ### Key Equation
> 
> **Mechanical Advantage (MA)**
> 
> $MA = \frac{d_1}{d_2} = \frac{F_{out}}{F_{in}}$ ; d1 is the distance of effort, d2 is the distance the object is moved

#### Example

You need to push a 500 kg grand piano onto a stage that is 3 m above the ground. If you can only apply a maximum force of 1000 N, what is the minimum distance from the stage that you should begin building your ramp?

We should start this problem by determining the mechanical advantage required to move the piano based on the [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") of the piano and the force you can apply. We'll define $F_{out}$ to be the force it would take to lift the piano straight up and $F_{in}$ to be the force you can apply.

$$
\begin{align*}
MA&=\frac{F_{out}}{F_{in}}\\
MA&=\frac{500\;\text{kg} * 9.8\;\text{m/s}^2}{1000\;\text{N}}\\
MA&=\frac{4900\;\text{N}}{1000\;\text{N}}\\
MA&=4.9\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can use this to find how long the ramp needs to be.

$$
\begin{align*}
MA&=\frac{d_{in}}{d_{out}}\\
d_{in}&=MAd_{out}\\
d_{in}&=4.9*3\;\text{m}\\

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2+b^2&=c^2\\
b&=\sqrt{c^2-a^2}\\
b&=\sqrt{(14.7\;\text{m})^2-(3\;\text{m})^2}\\
b&=14.4\;\text{m}\\
\end{align*}
$$

## 9.0 Rotational Motion

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/108.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

The third conservation law is _conservation of angular momentum._ This vector quantity is the product of rotational velocity and rotational inertia. In any closed system (including the universe) the quantity of angular momentum is fixed. Angular momentum can be transferred from one body to another, but cannot be lost or gained. If a system has its angular momentum changed from the outside it is caused by a torque. Torque is a force applied at a distance from the center of rotation.

These equations work in the case of constant angular acceleration. Use them just as you would use the linear kinematic equations studied in the One-Dimensional Motion lessons. Just replace displacement with the change in angle, the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") with the angular velocity and the acceleration with the angular acceleration.

* When something rotates in a circle, it moves through a _position angle_ $\theta$ that runs from $0$ to $2\pi$ radians and starts over again at $0$. The physical [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") it moves is called the _path length._ If the radius of the circle is larger, the path length traveled is longer.

* The angular velocity $\omega$ tells you how quickly the angle $\theta$ changes. In more formal language, the rate of change of $\theta$, the angular position, is called the angular velocity $\omega$. The direction of angular velocity is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Analogously, the rate of change of $\omega$ is the angular acceleration $\alpha$.

* The linear velocity and linear acceleration of rotating object also depend on the radius of rotation, which is called the _moment arm_ (See figure below.) If something is rotating at a constant angular velocity, it moves more quickly if it is farther from the center of rotation. For instance, people at the Earth’s equator are moving faster than people at northern latitudes, even though their day is still 24 hours long – this is because they have a greater circumference to travel in the same amount of time.

![0](media/109.png "Figure 1: #### Example")

A 2 kg mass is attached to a .5 m long string. Starting from rest, the mass is given a constant angular acceleration of 2 rad/s_2_. If the string breaks when the tension exceeds 50 N, how long will it be before the string breaks and what will the object's angular displacement be?

To start, we first want to find the object's linear speed when the string breaks.

$$
\begin{align*}
F_c&=\frac{mv^2}{r}\\
v&=\sqrt{\frac{F_cr}{m}}\\
v&=\sqrt{\frac{50\:\text{N} * .5\:\text{m}}{2\:\text{kg}}}\\
v&=3.53\:\text{m/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can find the angular speed.

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega&=\frac{v}{r}\\
\omega&=\frac{3.53\:\text{m/s}}{.5\:\text{m}}\\
\omega&=7.06\:\text{rad/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can begin finding the values asked in the problem based on this information using the equations from the section above. We'll start by finding the time before the string breaks.

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega&=\alpha*t\\
t&=\frac{\omega}{\alpha}\\
t&=\frac{7.1\:\text{rad/s}}{2\:\text{rad/s}^2}\\
t&=3.53\:\text{s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Lastly, we'll find the angular displacement of the mass.

$$
\begin{align*}
\omega^2&=\omega_o^2 + 2\alpha\Delta\theta\\
\omega^2&= 0 + 2\alpha\Delta\theta\\
\Delta\theta&=\frac{\omega^2}{2\alpha}\\
\Delta\theta&=\frac{(7.06\;\text{rad/s})^2}{2*2\:\text{rad/s}^2}\\
\Delta\theta&=12.5\;\text{rad}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 9.2 Moment of Inertia

<article>

 

Moment of inertia tells you how difficult it is to rotate an object. It is equivalent to the mass in linear problems. Moment of inertia is proportional to an objects mass and to it's [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the rotational axis squared. The distance from the rotational axis dominates over the objects mass due to the square power. Thus the more mass an object has at it's 'edges' the more moment of inertia it has. Thus if you grab a big long pole and hold it at the center, it is fairly easy to rotate. However, if you hold the same pole at the end and try to rotate it -not so easy! Finally, moment of inertias can be added as long as the rotating parts in question are rotating around the same axis. For example, the moment of inertia of a pole with a mass at its end is the sum of the individual moment of inertias of each object involved. See example 2 for another problem where the moment of inertias are added together.

#### Example

Two 2 kg masses is placed at either end of a rod that has a mass of .5 kg and a length of 3 m. What is the moment of inertia if the system it is rotated about (a) one end of the rod and (b) the center of the rod?

For both parts of this problem we will be summing the moment of inertia's for each component of the system based on the table above. We will treat the masses as satellites when calculating their moment of inertia's.

(a) For this part, we'll only add the value for the rod being rotated about one end and one of the masses because one of the masses is at the axis of rotation.

$$
\begin{align*}
I&=\Sigma I_i = \frac{1}{3}mL^2 + ML^2\\
 I&=\frac{1}{3}.5\text{kg} * (3\;\text{m})^2 + 2\;\text{kg} * (3\;\text{m})^2\\
 I&=19.5\;\text{kg*m}^2\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b) For the second part, we'll sum the moment of inertia's of both masses and the rod being rotated about it's center.

$$
\begin{align*}
I&=\frac{1}{12}m(\frac{L}{2})^2 + 2M(\frac{L}{2})^2\\
 I&=\frac{1}{12}.5\;\text{kg}*(\frac{3\text{m}}{2})^2 + 2 * 2\;\text{kg} * (\frac{3\text{m}}{2})^2\\
 I&=9.1\;\text{kg*m}^2\\
\end{align*}

### 9.3 Torque

<article>

 

Torque is equal to the cross product as stated above. In general, one can simplify by saying that the torque is equal to the force acting on the object multiplied by the perpendicular [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the application of the force to the rotational axis. Say you had a seesaw. It is easier to exert torque, get the seesaw to move, if you pushed on the board near the end rather than near the middle. It is the rotational version of Force.

Individual torques are determined by multiplying the force applied by the _perpendicular_ component of the moment arm

![0](media/114.png "Figure 1: There will be multiple steps to this problem. First we'll make a free body diagram for the rod; making [free body diagrams](/c/physics/free-body-diagrams "free body diagrams") in torque problems is just as important as in Newton's Laws problems. In the diagram, the force of tension from the cable, the rod's [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight"), and the forces from the hinge are shown. For the purposes of calculating torque, an object's weight acts from its center of mass (half way along the rod in this case).

### 9.4 Newton's Second Law for Rotation

<article>

Use this law just as you did in the Newton's Laws lessons. First choose a pivot point to take **all** torques around, and then add up all the torques acting on an object and that will equal the [moment of inertia](/c/physics/moment-of-inertia "moment of inertia") multiplied by the angular [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration").

**Torques** produce angular accelerations, but just as masses resist acceleration (due to inertia), there is an [inertia](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.2/primary/lesson/inertia-ms-ps "inertia") that opposes angular acceleration. The measure of this inertial [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") depends on the mass, but more importantly on the distribution of the mass in a given object. **The** **_moment of inertia,_** $I,$ **is the rotational version of mass.** Values for the moment of inertia of common objects are given above. Torques have only two directions: those that produce clockwise (CW) and those that produce counterclockwise (CCW) rotations. The angular acceleration or change in $\omega$ would be in the direction of the [torque](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/8.1/primary/lesson/torque-physics-intermediate "torque").

Many separate torques can be applied to an object. The angular acceleration produced is $\alpha = \tau_{net}/I$.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $\alpha = \tau_{net} / I$
> 
> Angular accelerations are produced by net torques,with inertia opposing acceleration; because $\alpha$ is the rotational version of a, linear acceleration, $\tau$ is the rotational version of F, force, and I is the rotational version of mass.
> 
> This is the rotational analog of Newton's 2nd law $a = F_{net} / m$
> 
> $\tau_{net} = \Sigma \tau_i = I \alpha$

> The net torque is the vector sum of all the torques acting on the object. When adding torques it is necessary to subtract CW from CCW torques.







#### Example

Some old doors have the door knob in the center of the door like in the picture below. If you had a door of mass 20 kg and 1.5 m wide, what would be the angular acceleration if you pushed at the center of the door with a force of 50 N? What would the angular acceleration be if you pushed at the far end of the door with the same force? Where should you push the door if you want to open it the fastest?

![0](media/117.png)\[Figure 1\]

To solve this problem, we will plug in the known values into Newton's second law for rotation and solve for $\alpha$. When calculating the moment of inertia of the door, we'll consider it a rod being rotated about one end. We'll first calculate the angular acceleration when pushing from the center of the door.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma\tau&=I\alpha\\
Fr&=I\alpha\\
Fr&=\frac{1}{3}mr^2\alpha\\
\alpha&=\frac{3Fr}{mr^2}\\
\alpha&=\frac{3*50\;\text{N}*.75\;\text{m}}{20\;\text{kg}*(1.5\;\text{m})^2}\\
\alpha&=2.5\;\text{rad/s}^2\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we'll calculate the angular acceleration when pushing from the end of the door.

$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha&=\frac{3Fr}{mr^2}\\
\alpha&=\frac{3*50\;\text{N}*1.5\text{m}}{20\;\text{kg}*(1.5\;\text{m})^2}\\
\alpha&=5\;\text{rad/s}^2\\
\end{align*}
$$

Clearly, it is much faster and easier to open doors when pushing from the point farthest from the hinge.

### 9.5 Yo-Yo Type Problems

<article>

 

In these types of problems it is very important to realize where the application of the force is acting. Remember that [Torque](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/8.1/primary/lesson/torque-physics-intermediate "Torque") is equal to the Force multiplied by the **perpendicular** [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the rotation axis. So if the CM is the rotation axis then there is not torque from gravity, as the distance from the rotation axis is zero. Also, in these types of problems, make sure to use Newton's laws in the linear form (i.e. $\Sigma F = ma$) and also in the rotation form (i.e. $\Sigma \tau_i = I \alpha$). Then you can substitute in for one of the unknowns and solve for the other.

#### Example

A wooden disk of mass m and radius r has a string of negligible mass is wrapped around it. If the the disk is allowed to fall and the string is held so that it unravels without sliding as the disk is falling, what will be the wooden disk's acceleration?

First, we'll draw a free body diagram for the situation. In the diagram below the force of gravity and the tension from the string have been labeled and are drawn from they points they are acting.

![0](media/121.png "Figure 1: Let's start by applying [Newton's second law](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.3/primary/lesson/newtons-second-law-ms-ps "Newton's second law") to this object and we'll let the positive direction be downward.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma F&=ma\\
mg-T&=ma\\
\end{align*}
$$

As you can see, we have two unknowns in this equation($T$ and $a$), so we're going to use [Newton's second law for rotation](/c/physics/newtons-second-law-for-rotation "Newton's second law for rotation") as our second equation and solve for $T$. The rotation axis is at the cm of the cylinder, thus there is no torque from gravity.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma \tau&=I\alpha\\
Tr&=I\alpha\\
T&=\frac{I\alpha}{r}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we will substitute in values for $I$ and $\alpha$. In order to calculate the [moment of inertia](/c/physics/moment-of-inertia "moment of inertia") of the wooden disk, we use the known formula for a disk being rotated about it's center.

$$
\begin{align*}
T&=\frac{\frac{1}{2}mr^2\alpha}{r} && \text{substituting for } I\\
T&=\frac{1}{2}mr^2\frac{a}{r}\frac{1}{r} && \text{substituting for } \alpha \text{ in terms of } a\\
T&=\frac{1}{2}ma && \text{simplifying the equation.}\\
\end{align*}
$$

We can now plug this back into our original Newton's second law equation from the first step.

$$
\begin{align*}
mg-T&=ma && \text{start with the equation from we derived in the first step}\\
mg-\frac{1}{2}ma&=ma && \text{substitute for T}\\
a&=\frac{2}{3}g && \text{simplifying and solving for a}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 9.6 Rolling Objects

<article>

 

When an object is rolling without slipping this means that $v = r \omega$ and $a = r \alpha$. This is also true in the situation of a rope on a [pulley](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/13.12/primary/lesson/pulley-ms-ps "pulley") that is rotating the pulley without slipping. Using this correspondence between linear and [angular speed](/c/physics/angular-speed "angular speed") and [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") is very useful for solving problems, but is only true if there is no slipping. Also, know that when the object is sliding, kinetic [friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "friction") is in play. When it is rolling, then static friction. Often, an object will start out rolling and sliding (kinetic friction) until it slows enough that it is rolling without sliding (static friction). One can set up a condition by forcing $v = r \omega$ and $a = r \alpha$ in order to find the point where it stops sliding. Finally, when this rolling object rolls down the incline, it gains [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") and loses [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy"), just like any object going down an incline. However, for rolling objects the kinetic energy is split between two forms: rotational and kinetic:

$KE_{Rolling Object} = \frac{1}2 m{v}^2 + \frac{1}2 I{\omega}^2$

Remember, if the object isn't sliding but perfectly rolling: $v = \omega r$

#### Example

You throw a bowling ball of mass $m$ and radius $r$ with an initial [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") $v_o$ down a flat bowling lane with a coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$. Initially, the ball slides down the lane not rotating at all, but after a time $\Delta t$, it begins to roll perfectly without sliding. Find $\Delta t$ in terms of the values given above.

We'll start by drawing an FBD for the bowling ball.

![0](media/124.png "Figure 1: We'll start by applying [Newton's second law](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.3/primary/lesson/newtons-second-law-ms-ps "Newton's second law") to the bowling ball. The force of friction is the only force in the x-direction.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma F_x&=ma_x && \text{start with Newton's second law}\\
f&=ma && \text{put in friction for the net force}\\
f&=m\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} && \text{substitute in the definition of acceleration. } \Delta t \text{ is the time it takes for the ball to begin rolling}\\
f&=m\frac{v_f-v_o}{\Delta t} && \text{substitute in } v_f \text{ and } v_o \text{, where } v_f \text{ is the velocity at the moment the ball begins rolling without sliding}\\
\end{align*}
$$

We now have two unknowns in our equation so we'll use [Newton's second law for rotation](/c/physics/newtons-second-law-for-rotation "Newton's second law for rotation") as our second equation to help us solve this problem. Using Newton's second law for rotation, we're going to determine a value for $v_f$ in terms of the other values.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma\tau&=I\alpha && \text{start Newton's second law for rotation}\\
fr&=I\alpha&& \text{substitute in friction for the net torque}\\
fr&=I\frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t} && \text{substitute in the definition of angular acceleration. } \Delta t \text{ is the time it takes for the ball to begin rolling}\\
fr&=I\frac{\omega_f - w_o}{\Delta t} && \text{substitute in } \omega_f \text{ and } \omega_o \text{ for } \Delta\omega\\
fr&=I\frac{\omega_f}{\Delta t} && \omega_o \text{ is zero so we an simplify the equation}\\
fr&=I\frac{v_f}{r\Delta t} && \text{since } \omega_f \text{ is the angular speed when the ball begins rolling without sliding, we can express it in terms of } v_f\\
v_f&=\frac{fr^2\Delta t}{I} && \text{solving for }v_f\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can put that value we just found back into our Newton's second law equation and solve for $\Delta t$.

$$
\begin{align*}
f&=m\frac{\frac{fr^2\Delta t}{I} - v_o}{\Delta t} && \text{making the substitution}\\
\Delta t&=\frac{mv_o}{\frac{mfr^2}{I} - f} && \text{solving for } \Delta t\\
\Delta t&=\frac{mv_o}{\frac{\mu_km^2gr^2}{I} - \mu_kmg} && \text{substitute the known values for } f \\
\Delta t&=\frac{mv_o}{\frac{\mu_km^2gr^2}{\frac{2}{5}mr^2} - \mu_kmg} && \text{substitute the known value for } I\\
\Delta t&=\frac{2}{3}\frac{v_o}{\mu_kg} && \text{simplify to get the answer}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 9.7 Rolling Energy Problems

<article>

 

You can use [energy conservation](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.7/primary/lesson/conservation-of-energy-phys "energy conservation") in rotation problems just like you did in the energy conservation lessons for linear motion. Note that rotating objects also have [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") of rotation and this must be included when accounting for energy conservation.

To solve this problem, we'll apply energy conservation to the hoop. The hoop only has gravitational [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy") at the top of the ramp, and it has both rotational and linear kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp.

### 9.8 Angular Momentum

<article>

 

The same principles that hold with linear [momentum](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/11.7/primary/lesson/momentum-ms-ps "momentum") conservation can be applied here with angular momentum conservation. The direction of _L_  is given by the right hand rule. Simply wrap your fingers around and in the direction the object is spinning and your thumb tells you the direction the vector is pointing.

![0](media/126.png "Figure 1: Angular momentum can not change unless an outside [torque](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/8.1/primary/lesson/torque-physics-intermediate "torque") is applied to the object.")

Recall that momentum is a vector quantity, thus the direction a spinning object is pointing can not change without an applied torque.

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> $L = I\omega$
> 
> $\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p} = r _\perp p = rp _\perp$

The _angular momentum_ of a spinning object can be found in two equivalent ways. Just like linear momentum, one way, shown in the first equation, is to multiply the [moment of inertia](/c/physics/moment-of-inertia "moment of inertia"), the rotational analog of mass, with the angular [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity"). The other way is simply multiplying the linear momentum by the radius, as shown in the second equation.

$\tau = \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta{t}}$

Just the same as linear momentum, the torque required to change the momentum L in t time (L/t) can be compared to the force required to change the momentum p in t time. (p/t) Torques produce a change in angular momentum with time.

## 10.0 Simple Harmonic Motion

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/127.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

The development of devices to measure time, like the pendulum, led to the analysis of _periodic motion_. Such motion repeats itself in equal intervals of time (called periods) and is also referred to as _harmonic motion._ When an object moves back and forth over the _same path_ in harmonic motion it is said to be _oscillating._ If the distance such an object travels in one oscillation remains constant, it is called _simple_ harmonic motion (SHM). A grandfather clock’s pendulum and the quartz crystal in a modern watch are examples of SHM.

### Examples

#### Example 1

A bee flaps its wings at a rate of approximately 190 Hz. How long does it take for a bee to flap its wings once (down and up)?

Question: $T = ?$ \[sec\]

Given: $f = 190 \ Hz$

Equation: $T = \frac{1}{f}$

Plug n’ Chug_:_ $T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{190 \ Hz} = 0.00526 \ s = 5.26 \ ms$

The answer is 5.26 ms.

#### Example 2

The effective $k$ of a diving board is $800\mathrm{N/m}$ (we say effective because it bends in the direction of motion instead of stretching like a spring, but otherwise behaves the same). A pudgy diver is bouncing up and down at the end of the diving board. The y vs. t graph is shown below.



![0](media/128.png)

\[Figure 1\]![0](media/129.png)\[Figure 2\]



a) What is the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") between the lowest and the highest point of oscillation?



As we can see from the graph the highest point is 2m and the lowest point is $-2\mathrm{m}$. Therefore the distance is 

$$
|2\mathrm{m}-(-2\mathrm{m})|=4\mathrm{m}
$$

b) What is the Period and frequency of the diver?



We know that 

$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$

 From the graph we know that the period is 2 seconds, so the frequency is $\frac{1}{2 }$hz.

c) What is the diver's mass?

To find the diver's mass we will use the equation 

$$
T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
$$

 and solve for $m$. Then it is a simple matter to plug in the known values to get the mass. 

$$
T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \Rightarrow \frac{T}{2\pi}=\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \Rightarrow (\frac{T}{2\pi})^2=\frac{m}{k} \Rightarrow k(\frac{T}{2\pi})^2=m
$$

 Now we plug in what we know. 

$$
m=k(\frac{T}{2\pi})^2=800\frac{N}{m}(\frac{\pi {\mathrm{s}}}{2\pi})^2=200\mathrm{kg}
$$

d) Write the sinusoidal equation of motion for the diver.

To get the sinusoidal equation we must first choose whether to go with a cosine graph or a sine graph. Then we must find the amplitude (A), vertical shift (D), horizontal shift (C), and period (B). Cosine is easier in this case so we will work with it instead of sine. As we can see from the graph, the amplitude is 2, the vertical shift is 0, and the horizontal shift is $-.4$. We solved for the period already. Therefore, we can write the sinusoidal equation of this graph. 

$$
AcosB(x-C)+D=2cos\pi(x+.4)
$$

### 10.2 Springs

<article>

The oscillating object does not lose any [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") in SHM. [Friction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.2/primary/lesson/friction-phys "Friction") is assumed to be zero.

In harmonic motion there is always a _restorative force,_ which attempts to _restore_ the oscillating object to its equilibrium position. The restorative force changes during an oscillation and depends on the position of the object. In a spring the force is given by Hooke’s Law: $F = -kx$

The period, $T$, is the amount of time needed for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle. In SHM, $T$ is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction.

The frequency, $f,$ is the number of cycles an object goes through in $1$ second. Frequency is measured in Hertz $(Hz)$. $1\ Hz = 1$ cycle per sec. The amplitude, $A$, is the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the _equilibrium_ (or center) _point_ of motion to either its lowest or highest point (_end points_). The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion, but is constant in SHM.

### 10.3 Pendulum

<article>

In harmonic motion there is always a _restorative force_, which acts in the opposite direction of the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity"). The restorative force changes during oscillation and depends on the position of the object. In a pendulum it is the component of gravity along the path of motion. The force on the oscillating object is directly opposite that of the direction of velocity. For pendulums, the period gets larger as the length of the pendulum increases.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $T_{\text{pendulum}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ ; Period of a pendulum of length L

#### Example

You have a mass swinging on the end of 1 m pendulum. If the maximum linear velocity of the mass is 2 m/s, (a) calculate the period of the pendulum and (b) calculate the amplitude of the pendulum.

To calculate the period of the pendulum, we can just plug in the given length into the equation above.

$$
\begin{align*}
T&=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\\
T&=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{1\:\text{m}}{9.8\:\text{m/s}^2}}\\
T&=2\:\text{s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

To find the amplitude, we'll use the equation given in the Period and Frequency lesson that gives us the velocity as a function of time. Since the problem says that the given velocity is the maximum velocity, we know that the pendulum is at the bottom of it's arc and 1/4th (or 3/4th's) of it's way through one period. Based on this knowledge, we can plug in 1/4 of the period for the change in time. We also know the frequency because we just found the period, so all we have to do is solve for the amplitude.

$$
\begin{align*}
v(t)&=-2\pi fA\cos(2\pi f\Delta t) && \text{start with the equation for velocity}\\
v_{max}&=-2\pi fA\cos(2\pi f\frac{1}{4}T) && \text{put in the terms we know}\\
A&=-\frac{v_{max}}{2\pi f\cos(2\pi f\frac{1}{4}T)} && \text{solve for the amplitude}\\
A&=-\frac{2\:\text{m/s}}{2\pi \frac{1}{2}\:\text{Hz}*\cos(2\pi *\frac{1}{2}\:\text{Hz}*\frac{1}{4}*2\:\text{s})} && \text{plug in the known values}\\
A&=.63\:\text{m}
\end{align*}
$$

### Explore More

We have explored two examples of simple harmonic motion: the pendulum and the mass-spring system in the previous lesson. The purpose of this investigation is to get you to notice the connections between the two systems. Your task: Match the period of the pendulum system with that of the spring system. You are only allowed to change the mass involved in the spring system. Consider the effective length of the pendulum to be fixed at 2m because that is the distance between the center of mass and the pivot. The spring constant(13.5N/m) is also fixed. You may use any relationships you have learned about to help you. You should view the charts to check whether you have succeeded.

Instructions: To alter the mass, simply click on the 'select' tool in the menu, and select the mass. Then use the tab at the bottom of your screen to change the density or dimensions of the block to get the mass that you want.

To view chart legend, click on Settings and you can plot velocity or position of the pendulum or mass on the spring.

## 11.0 Wave Motion and Sound

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/132.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in _harmonic motion._ Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances. They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact with the initial source. Since waves are disturbances in an existing medium, they are considered phenomena and not actual objects.



</article>

### 11.1 Types of Waves

<article>

 

The **period**, $T$, is the amount of time for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle. In SHM, $T$ is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction. The period of a wave depends on the period of oscillation of the object creating the wave.

The **frequency**, $f$, is the number of cycles an object or wave goes through in 1 second. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec.

The **amplitude**, $A$, is the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the _equilibrium_ (or center) _point_ of motion to either its lowest or highest point (_end points_). The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion but is constant in SHM. The amplitude of a wave often determines its strength or intensity; the exact meaning of "strength" depends on the type of wave. For example, a [sound wave](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/12.1/primary/lesson/sound-waves "sound wave") with a large amplitude is a loud sound and a light wave with a large amplitude is very bright.

A **medium** is the substance through which the wave travels. For example, water acts as the medium for ocean waves, while air molecules act as the medium for [sound waves](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/12.1/primary/lesson/sound-waves "sound waves"). When a wave passes through a medium, the medium is only temporarily disturbed. When an ocean wave travels from one side of the Mediterranean Sea to the other, no actual water molecules move this great distance. Only the _disturbance_ propagates (moves) through the medium. An object oscillating with frequency $f$ will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency $f$. The **[speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed")** $v$ **and [wavelength](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.6/primary/lesson/wavelength-ms-ps "wavelength")** $\lambda$ of a wave depend on the nature of the medium through which the wave travels.

There are two main types of waves we will consider: **longitudinal** and **transverse** waves.

In **longitudinal** waves, the vibrations of the medium are in the _same direction_ as the wave motion. A classic example is a wave traveling down a line of standing dominoes: each domino will fall in the same direction as the motion of the wave. A more physical example is a sound wave. For sound waves, high and low pressure zones move both forward and backward as the wave moves through them.

In **transverse** waves, the vibrations of the medium are _perpendicular_ to the direction of motion. A classic example is a wave created in a long rope: the wave travels from one end of the rope to the other, but the actual rope moves up and down, and not from left to right as the wave does. Water waves act as a mix of longitudinal and transverse waves. A typical water molecule pretty much moves in a circle when a wave passes through it.

Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by [springs](/c/physics/springs "springs") (intermolecular forces). The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of [simple harmonic motion](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/11.1/primary/lesson/simple-harmonic-motion-phys "simple harmonic motion"). The speed of a wave on a string depends on the material the string is made of, as well as the tension in the string. This fact is why _tightening_ a string on your violin or guitar will _increase_ the frequency, or pitch, of the sound it produces.

### 11.2 Wave Equation

<article>

 

The wave equation is analogous to _[distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") equals rate multiplied by time_ equation for one cycle. Here the distance is a [wavelength](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.6/primary/lesson/wavelength-ms-ps "wavelength") and the time is the period. We simply divide both sides by the period, to get [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of the wave equals the wavelength multiplied by one over the period. This is equivalent to wavelength multiplied by frequency, since frequency equals one of the period by definition.

#### Example 

While on vacation in Hawaii you observe waves at the Banzai Pipeline approaching the shore at 6.0 m/s. You also note that the distance between waves is 28 m. Calculate (a) the frequency of the waves and (b) the period.

a. Question: $f= ? [Hz]$

Given: $v = 6.0 \ m/s$

${\;} \qquad \quad \lambda = 28 \ m$

Equation: $v = f \cdot \lambda$ therefore $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$

Plug n’ Chug: $f = \frac{v} {\lambda} = \frac{6.0 \ m/s}{28 \ m} = 0.21 \ Hz$

The answer is 0.21 Hz.

b.Question: $T = ? [s]$

Given: $f = 0.21 \ Hz$

Equation: $T = \frac{1}{f}$

Plug n’ Chug: $T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.21 \ Hz} = 4.76 \ s$

The answer is 4.76 s.

### 11.3 Beat Frequencies

<article>

**Constructive interference** occurs when two waves combine to create a larger wave. This occurs when the peaks of two waves line up. **Destructive interference** occurs when two waves combine and cancel each other out. This occurs when a peak in one wave lines up with a trough in the other wave. When waves of two different frequencies interfere, a phenomenon known as _beating_ occurs. The frequency of a beat is the difference of the two frequencies.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 -f_2|$ ; two interfering waves create a beat wave with frequency equal to the difference in their frequencies

#### Example 

You want to find out the frequency of a tuning fork. When you strike the unknown fork and a fork which is known to create a sound at 100 Hz at the same time, you hear a beat frequency of 3 Hz. You strike the unknown fork a second time, but this time with a tuning fork rated for 105 Hz and you hear a beat frequency of 2 Hz. What is the frequency of the unknown fork?

Each test gives us two possibilities for a frequency. Based on the first test, the unknown fork could either be rated for 97 Hz or 103 Hz. Based on the second test, the frequency of the unknown fork could either be 103 Hz or 107 Hz. The two tests agree on 103 Hz, so that must be the frequency of the unknown tuning fork.

### 11.4 Doppler Effect

<article>

 

The **Doppler Effect** occurs when either the source of a wave or the observer of a wave (or both) are moving. When a source of a wave is moving towards you, the apparent frequency of the wave you detect is higher than that emitted. For instance, if a car approaches you while playing a note at 500 Hz, the sound you hear will be slightly higher frequency. The opposite occurs (the frequency observed is lower than emitted) for a receding wave or if the observer moves away from the source. It’s important to note that the [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of the wave does not change –it’s traveling through the same medium so the speed is the same. Due to the relative motion between the source and the observer the frequency changes, but not the speed of the wave. Note that while the effect is similar for light and [electromagnetic waves](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/13.1/primary/lesson/electromagnetic-waves-ms-ps "electromagnetic waves") the formulas are not exactly the same as for sound.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> **Doppler Shifts**: 
> 
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> f_o &= f \frac{v+v_o}{v-v_s} && f_o \mathrm{~(observed~frequency)~is~shifted~up~when~source~and~observer~moving~closer}\\
> f_o &= f \frac{v-v_o}{v+v_s} && f_o \mathrm{~(observed~frequency)~is~shifted~down~when~source~and~observer~moving~apart, where}\\
> & && v \text{ is the speed of sound, } v_s \text{ is the speed of the source, and } v_o \text{ is the speed of the observer}
> \end{align*}
> $$
> 
>

#### Example

How fast would a student playing an A note ($440\mathrm{Hz}$) have to move towards you in order for you to hear a G note ($784\mathrm{Hz}$)?

We will use the Doppler shift equation for when the objects are getting closer together and solve for the speed of the student (the source).

$$
f_o=f(\frac{v+v_o}{v-v_s}) \Rightarrow f_o\times (v-v_s)=f\times (v+v_o) \Rightarrow vf_o-v_sf_o=f\times (v+v_o) \Rightarrow v_s=-(\frac{f\times (v+v_o)-vf_o}{f_o})
$$

Now we plug in the known values to solve for the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of the student.

$$
v_s=-(\frac{f\times (v+v_o)-vf_o}{f_o})=-(\frac{440\mathrm{Hz}\times (343\mathrm{m/s}+0\mathrm{m/s})-343\mathrm{m/s}\times 784\mathrm{Hz}}{784\mathrm{Hz}})=151\mathrm{m/s}

### 11.5 Sound

<article>

Sound waves are longitudinal waves. Thus, the molecules of the medium vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the wave is traveling through. The medium for sound is normally air for humans, but sound waves can travel in water, metal, etc. as well. An object oscillating with frequency $f$ will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency $f$. The [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of a [sound wave](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/12.1/primary/lesson/sound-waves "sound wave") in air depends subtly on pressure, density, and [temperature](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/temperature-ms-ps "temperature"), but is about 343 m/s at room temperature.

#### Example

Describe the pressure changes in the air as a sound wave passes a given point, then explain why a very loud sound can damage your tympanic membrane (ear drum).

As a sound wave passes a certain point, the air pressure at that point alternates between high and low pressure. When sound waves pass into the ear, the alternating pressures cause a pressure difference on either side of the tympanic membrane. The pressure differences between the inside and outside of the membrane cause the membrane to move back and forth with the same frequency as the changes in pressure. What we perceive as very loud sounds are sound waves with very large amplitudes, meaning that the differences in pressure are very large. The larger changes in pressure could cause damage to the membrane by causing it to vibrate too violently.

### 11.6 Sound in a Tube

<article>

 

In the case of a tube that is open at one end, a node is forced at the closed end (no air molecules can vibrate up and down) and an antinode occurs at the open end (here, air molecules are free to move). A different spectrum of [standing waves](/c/physics/standing-waves "standing waves") is produced. For instance, the fundamental standing [sound wave](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/12.1/primary/lesson/sound-waves "sound wave") produced in a tube closed at one end is shown below. In this case, the amplitude of the standing wave is referring to the magnitude of the air pressure variations. 

![0](media/135.png "Figure 1: This standing wave is the first harmonic and one can see that the [wavelength](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.6/primary/lesson/wavelength-ms-ps "wavelength") is $\lambda = 4L$. Since $v = \lambda f$, the frequency of oscillation is $f = v/4L$. In general, the frequency of oscillation is $f = nv/4L$, where $n$ is always odd.")



> ### Key Equations
> 
> $v = \lambda f$
> 
> **for a tube closed at one end**
> 
> $f =nv /4L$, where $n$ is always odd
> 
> **for a tube open at both ends**
> 
> $f =nv /2L$, where $n$ is an integer

#### Example

The objects A, B, and C below represent graduated cylinders of length 50 cm which are filled with water to the depths of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively as shown.

![0](media/136.png "Figure 2: a) If you blow in each of these tubes, which (A,B,C) will produce the highest frequency sound?")



The water forms the bottom of the tube and thus where the node of the wave will be. Thus the air column is where the sound wave can exist. The larger the air column, the larger the wavelength. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, thus the tube with the smallest air column will have the highest frequency. So the answer is tube C.

b) What is the wavelength of the 1st harmonic (i.e. fundamental) of tube B?

The air column is 50 cm - 20 cm = 30 cm. The first harmonic has a quarter wavelength in the tube. Thus $\lambda = 4 \times L$. Thus, $\lambda = 4 \times 30 \text{cm} = 120 \text{cm}$

c) The [speed of sound](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/12.2/primary/lesson/speed-of-sound-ms-ps "speed of sound") at room [temperature](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/temperature-ms-ps "temperature") is about 343 m/s. What is the frequency of the 1st harmonic for tube B?

Using the [wave equation](/c/physics/wave-equation "wave equation") for the first harmonic (thus, n = 1) of a tube open at one end we get $f = \frac{v}{4L} = \frac{343 \text{m/s}}{1.2 \text{m}}= 286 \text{Hz}$

### Review

![0](media/137.png "Figure 3: 1.  Aborigines, the native people of Australia, play an instrument called the Didgeridoo like the one shown above. The Didgeridoo produces a low pitch sound and is possibly the world’s oldest instrument. The one shown above is about 1.3 m long and open at both ends.")
    1.  Knowing that when a tube is open at both ends there must be an antinode at both ends, draw the first 3 harmonics for this instrument.
    2.  Calculate the frequency of the first 3 harmonics assuming room temperature and thus a velocity of sound of 340 m/s. Then take a shot at deriving a generic formula for the frequency of the $n$th standing wave mode for the Didgeridoo, as was done for the string tied at both ends and for the tube open at one end.
2.  Students are doing an experiment to determine the speed of sound in air. They hold a tuning fork above a large empty graduated cylinder and try to create resonance. The air column in the graduated cylinder can be adjusted by putting water in it. At a certain point for each tuning fork a clear resonance point is heard. The students adjust the water finely to get the peak resonance then carefully measure the air column from water to top of air column. (The assumption is that the tuning fork itself creates an anti-node and the water creates a node.) The following data were collected:

| **Frequency of tuning fork (Hz)** | **Length of air column (cm)** | **Wavelength (m)** | **Speed of sound (m/s)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 184 | 46  |     |     |

Please draw the waves as transverse even though we know sound waves are longitudinal (reason for this, obviously, is that it is much easier to draw transverse waves rather than longitudinal). Note that the tube is CLOSED at one end and OPEN at the other. ![0](media/138.png "Figure 4: b. Calculate the frequencies of the first three harmonics played in this tube, if the speed of sound in the tube is 340 m/s.")

c. The speed of sound in carbon dioxide is lower than in air. If the bottle contained $CO2$ instead of air, would the frequencies found above be higher or lower? Knowing that the pitch of your voice gets higher when you inhale helium, what can we say about the speed of sound in $He$.

### 11.7 Standing Waves

<article>

 

A typical standing wave is shown below. This is the motion of a simple jump-rope. _Nodes_ are the places where the rope doesn’t move at all; _antinodes_ occur where the motion is greatest.

![0](media/139.png "Figure 1: For this wave, the wavelength is . Since , the frequency of oscillation is .")

**Higher harmonics** can also form. Note that each end, where the rope is attached, must always be a node. Below is an example of a rope in a 5_th_ harmonic standing wave.

![0](media/140.png "Figure 2: In general, the frequency of oscillation is , where n is the number of antinodes. The thick, dotted lines represent the wave _envelope_: these are the upper and lower limits to the motion of the string.")

Importantly, each of the above standing wave examples can also apply to [sound waves](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/12.1/primary/lesson/sound-waves "sound waves") in a closed tube, [electromagnetic waves](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/13.1/primary/lesson/electromagnetic-waves-ms-ps "electromagnetic waves") in a wire or fiber optic cable, and so on. In other words, the standing wave examples can apply to _any_ kind of wave, as long as nodes are forced at both ends by whatever is containing/reflecting the wave back on itself.

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when something that has a natural frequency of vibration ([pendulum](/c/physics/pendulum "pendulum"), guitar, glass, etc.) is shaken or pushed at a frequency that is equal to its natural frequency of vibration. The most dramatic example is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge due to wind causing vibrations at the bridge's natural frequency. The result is the dramatic collapse of a very large suspension bridge.

> ###   Key Equations
> 
>  **Standing waves for a string restricted at both ends or unrestricted at both ends**
> 
> $f_n = \frac{n v}{2L} \; \text{ ; n is an integer}$

#### Example

You want to create a 4th harmonic standing wave standing wave of frequency 10 Hz on a rope. Prior to conducting your experiment, you are able to create a 1st harmonic standing wave with the exact same kind of rope at the same tension and you measure the frequency to be 3 Hz. What length of rope will you need to use in order to create your 4th harmonic standing wave at 10 Hz?

This is a two step problem. We'll start by finding how fast waves travel along the rope using the information from the prior test.

$$
\begin{align*}
f_1&=\frac{nv}{2L}\\
v&=\frac{f_12L}{n}\\
v&=\frac{3\:\text{Hz} * 2 * 1\:\text{m}}{1}\\
v&=6\text{m/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now that we have the [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of waves on the rope, we can use that to find the length we need.

$$
\begin{align*}
f_4&=\frac{nv}{2L}\\
L&=\frac{nv}{2f_4}\\
L&=\frac{4*6\:\text{m/s}}{2*10\:\text{Hz}}\\
L&=1.2\:\text{m}\\
\end{align*}

## 12.0 Electricity

Introduction
------------

![0](media/143.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

_Conservation of charge_ is the fourth of the five conservation laws in physics. There are two charges, positive and negative, and the conservation of electric charge indicates that the total charge in the universe remains the same. In any closed system charge can be transferred from one body to another or can move within the system but the total electric charge remains constant.

_Electromagnetism_ is associated with charge and is a fundamental force of nature, like gravity. If charges are static, the only manifestation of electromagnetism is the _Coulomb electric force._ In the same way that gravitational force depends on mass, the Coulomb electric force depends on the property known as electric _charge._ Like gravity, the Coulomb electric Force decreases with the square of the distance. The Coulomb electric force is responsible for many of the forces we discussed previously: the normal force, contact forces such as friction, and so on - _all_ of these forces arise in the mutual attraction and repulsion of charged particles.

The law determining the magnitude of the Coulomb electric force has the same form as the law of gravity. However the electric constant is $20$ orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational constant. That is why electricity normally dominates gravity at the atomic and molecular level. Since there is only one type of mass but two types of charge, gravity will dominate in large bodies _unless there is a separation of charge._

Opposite charges attract and like charges repulse. The electron (and proton) is the fundamental charge unit. The charge of an electron and proton is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C. One can determine the number of excess electrons (or protons if positive charge) by dividing the objects charge by the fundamental charge. Most objects are electrically neutral (equal numbers of electrons and protons) and that's why gravity dominates on a macro scale.

### 12.2 Coulomb's Law

<article>

 

The Coulomb Force Law states that any two charged particles $(q_1,q_2)$ --- with charge measured in units of Coulombs --- at a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") $r$ from each other will experience a force of repulsion or attraction along the line joining them equal to:

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{F_e} &= \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} && \text{The Coulomb Force [1]}\\
\text{Where }
 k &= 8.987 \times 10^9 \ \mathrm{N  \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2}} && \text{The Electric Constant}
\end{align*}
$$

This looks a lot like the Law of Universal Gravitation, which deals with attraction between objects with mass. The big difference is that while any two masses experience mutual _attraction_, two charges can either attract or repel each other, depending on whether the signs of their charges are alike:

![0](media/144.png "Figure 1: Like gravitational (and all other) forces, Coulomb forces add as [vectors](/c/physics/vectors "vectors"). Thus to find the force on a charge from an arrangement of charges, one needs to find the vector sum of the force from each charge in the arrangement.")

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> F = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2}
> \begin{cases}
> k & \text{The electric constant,}\ k =  8.987 \times 10^9 \ \mathrm{N  \cdot m^2 C^{-2}}. \\
> q_1, \ q_2 & \text{Magnitude of the charges, units of Coulombs (C)}\\
> r & \text{Distance between charges, m}
> \end{cases}
> \end{align*}
> $$

#### Example

Two negatively charged spheres (one with $-12\mu\mathrm{C}$; the other with $-3\mu\mathrm{C}$) are $3\mathrm{m}$ apart. Where could you place an electron so that it will be suspended in space between them with a net force of zero (for this problem we will ignore the force of repulsion between the two charges because they are held in place)?

![0](media/145.png "Figure 2: Consider the diagram above; here $r_{s\rightarrow e}$ is the distance between the electron and the small charge, while $\vec{F}_{s\rightarrow e}$ is the force the electron feels due to it. For the electron to be balanced in between the two charges, the forces of repulsion caused by the two charges on the electron would have to be balanced. To do this, we will set the equation for the force exerted by two charges on each other equal and solve for a distance ratio. We will denote the difference between the charges through the subscripts "s" for the smaller charge, "e" for the electron, and "l" for the larger charge.")

$$
\frac{kq_sq_e}{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}=\frac{kq_lq_e}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2}
$$

Now we can cancel. The charge of the electron cancels. The constant $k$ also cancels. We can then replace the large and small charges with the numbers. This leaves us with the distances. We can then manipulate the equation to produce a ratio of the distances.

$$
\frac{-3\mu\mathrm{C}}{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}=\frac{-12\mu\mathrm{C}}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2} \Rightarrow \frac{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2}=\frac{-12\mu\mathrm{C}}{-3\mu\mathrm{C}} \Rightarrow 
\frac{r_{s\rightarrow e}}{r_{e\rightarrow l}}=\sqrt{\frac{1\mu\mathrm{C}}{4\mu\mathrm{C}}}=\frac{1}{2}
$$

Given this ratio, we know that the electron is twice as far from the large charge ($-12\mu\mathrm{C}$) as from the small charge ($-3\mu\mathrm{C}$). Given that the distance between the small and large charges is $3\mathrm{m}$, we can determine that the electron must be located $2\mathrm{m}$ away from the large charge and $1\mathrm{m}$ away from the smaller charge.

### 12.3 Voltage

<article>

 

Like gravity, the electric force can do work and has a [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy") associated with it. But like we use fields to keep track of electromagnetic forces, we use **electric potential**, or **voltage** to keep track of electric potential energy. So instead of looking for the potential energy of specific objects, we define it in terms of properties of the space where the objects are.

The **electric potential difference**_,_ or **voltage difference** (often just called voltage) between two points (A and B) in the presence of an electric field is defined as the work it would take to move a **positive test charge of magnitude 1** from the first point to the second against the electric force provided by the field. For any other charge $q$, then, the relationship between potential difference and work will be:

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta V_{AB} &= \frac{W_{AB}}{q} \ \ \ \ \text{[4] Electric Potential}
\end{align*}
$$

Rearranging, we obtain:

$$
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{W}_{\text{Work}} &= \underbrace{\Delta V_{AB}}_{\text{Potential Difference}} \times \underbrace{q}_{\text{Charge}}
\end{align*}
$$

The potential of electric forces to do work corresponds to electric potential energy:  

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta U_{E,AB} &= q\Delta V_{AB} \ \ \text{[5] Potential energy change due to voltage change}
\end{align*}
$$

The [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") that the object gains or loses when traveling through a potential difference is supplied (or absorbed) by the electric field --- there is nothing else there. Therefore, it follows that [electric fields](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/the-electric-field-phys "electric fields") contain energy.

To summarize: just as an electric field denotes force per unit charge, so electric potential differences represent potential energy differences per unit charge. Voltage is by definition the electric potential energy per Coulomb. So it is the electrical potential energy value divided by the charge. Thus, voltage difference is the potential value for potential energy. A 12V battery can not produce energy without charge flowing (i.e. you must connect the two ends). Electric potential is measured in units of Volts $(V)$ – thus electric potential is often referred to as “voltage.” Electric potential is the source of the electric potential energy. You can read the electric potential lines (that is the voltage lines) just like you would a contour map while backpacking in the mountains. Positive charges move towards lower electric potential; negative charges move toward higher electric potential. Thus, positive charges go 'downhill' and negative charges go 'uphill'.

#### Example

You have a negative charge of unknown value and a positive charge of magnitude $q_1$ and mass $m$. After fixing the negative charge in place, you place the positive charge a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") $r_i$ away from the negative charge and then release it. If the [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of the positive charge when it is a distance $r_f$ away from the negative charge is $v$, what was the magnitude of the negative charge in terms of the given values?

There are multiple ways to do this problem, we will solve it using [conservation of energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.7/primary/lesson/conservation-of-energy-phys "conservation of energy") and the change in voltage to determine the magnitude of the negative charge. When working through this problem, we'll call the positive charge $q_1$ and the negative charge $q_2$. To start we'll say that the charge had zero potential energy when it was .5m from the negative charge; this will help us as we work through the problem. Using this assertion, we will apply conservation of energy to the positive charge.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta U_e&=KE_f && \text{start with conservation of energy}\\
q_1\Delta V&=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 && \text{substitute the equations for each energy term}\\
\Delta V&=\frac{mv^2}{2q_1} && \text{solve for V}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now, since we know the voltage difference, we will express it using the equation for voltage at a certain distance from a point charge.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta V&=\frac{kq_2}{\Delta r} && \text{start with the equation for voltage at a certain distance}\\
\Delta V&=\frac{kq_2}{r_f}-\frac{kq_2}{r_i} && \text{express the change in radius in terms of the initial and final radius of the positive charge}\\
\Delta V&=kq_2(\frac{1}{r_f}-\frac{1}{r_i}) && \text{factor the equation}\\
\frac{mv^2}{2q_1}&=kq_2(\frac{1}{r_f}-\frac{1}{r_i}) && \text{substitute in the value from the first step}\\
q_2&=\frac{mv^2}{2q_1k(\frac{1}{r_f}-\frac{1}{r_i})} && \text{solve for }q_2\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 12.4 Electric Fields

<article>

 

Gravity and the Coulomb force have a nice property in common: they can be represented by **fields**. Fields are a kind of bookkeeping tool used to keep track of forces. Take the electromagnetic force between two charges given above: 

$$
\vec{F_e} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}
$$

 If we are interested in the [acceleration](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.7/primary/lesson/acceleration-ms-ps "acceleration") of the first charge only --- due to the force from the second charge --- we can rewrite this force as the product of ${q_1}$ and $\frac{kq_2}{r^2}$. The first part of this product only depends on properties of the object we're interested in (the first charge), and the second part can be thought of as a property of the point in space where that object is.

In fact, the quantity $\frac{kq_2}{r^2}$ captures everything about the electromagnetic force on any object possible at a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") **r** from $q_2$. If we had replaced $q_1$ with a different charge, $q_3$, we would simply multiply $q_3$ by $\frac{kq_2}{r^2}$ to find the new force on the new charge. Such a quantity, $\frac{kq_2}{r^2}$ here, is referred to as the electric field from charge $q_2$ at that point: in this case, it is the electric field due to a single charge: 

$$
\vec{E_f} = \frac{kq}{r^2}
$$

The electric field is a vector quantity, and points in the direction that a force felt by a positive charge at that point would. If we are given the electric field at some point, it is just a matter of multiplication --- as illustrated above --- to find the force any charge $q_0$ would feel at that point: 

$$
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\vec{F_e}}_{\text{Force on charge }q_0} = \underbrace{\vec{E_f}}_{\text{Field}} \underbrace{\times q_0}_{\text{Charge}} &&\text{Force on charge }q_0\text{ in an electric field}
\end{align*}
$$

 Note that this is true for _all_ electric fields, not just those from point charges. In general, the **electric field** at a point _is the force a_ **_positive test charge of magnitude 1_** _would feel at that point_. Any other charge will feel a force along the same line (but possibly in the other direction) in proportion to its magnitude. In other words, the electric field can be thought of as "force per unit charge".

> ### Key Equations  
> 
>   $E = \frac{k q}{r^2} \; \;$ ; Electric field due to charge $q$ at a distance _r_ from the charge.
> 
> $F = q E \; \;$ ; Force due to an electric field.

In the case given above, the field was due to a single charge. Such a field is shown in the figure below. Notice that this a field due to a positive charge, since the field arrows are pointing outward. The field produced by a point charge will be radially symmetric i.e., the strength of the field only depends on the distance, $r$, from the charge, not the direction; the lengths of the arrows represent the strength of the field.

![0](media/153.png "Figure 1: #### Example")

Calculate the electric field a distance of $4.0\mathrm{mm}$ away from a $-2.0\mu \mathrm{C}$ charge. Then, calculate the force on a $-8.0\mu \mathrm{C}$ charge placed at this point.

To calculate the electric field we will use the equation 

$$
E=\frac{kq}{r^2}
$$

 Before we solve for the electric field by plugging in the values, we convert all of the values to the same units.

$$
\begin{align*}
4.0\mathrm{mm}\times \frac{1\mathrm{m}}{1000\mathrm{mm}}&=.004\mathrm{m}\\
-2.0\mu \mathrm{C}\times \frac{1\mathrm{C}}{1000000\mu \mathrm{C}}&=-2.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C}
\end{align*}
$$

Now that we have consistent units we can solve the problem.

$$
E=\frac{kq}{r^2}=\frac{9\times 10^9\mathrm{Nm^2/C^2}\times -2.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C}}{(.004\mathrm{m})^2}=-1.1\times 10^9\mathrm{N/C}
$$

To solve for the force at the point we will use the equation 

$$
F=Eq
$$

 . We already know all of the values so all we have to do is convert all of the values to the same units and then plug in the values.

$$
-8.0\mu \mathrm{C}\times \frac{1\mathrm{C}}{1000000\mu \mathrm{C}}=-8.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C}\\
$$

$$
F=Eq=-8.0\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{C} \times -1.1 \times 10^9 \mathrm{N/C}=9000\mathrm{N}
$$

## 13.0 Electric Circuits: Batteries and Resistors

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/161.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Ideas")

The name _electric current_ is given to the phenomenon that occurs when an electric field moves down a wire at close to the speed of light. _Voltage_ is the electrical energy density (energy divided by charge) and differences in this density (voltage) cause electric current. _Resistance_ is the amount a device in the wire resists the flow of current by converting electrical energy into other forms of energy. A device, the resistor, could be a light bulb, transferring electrical energy into heat and light or an electric motor that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. The difference in energy density across a resistor or other electrical device is called _voltage drop._

In electric _circuits_ (closed loops of wire with resistors and constant voltage sources) energy must be conserved. It follows that changes in energy density, the algebraic sum of voltage drops and voltage sources, around any closed loop will equal zero.

In an electric _junction_ there is more than one possible path for current to flow. For charge to be conserved at a junction the current into the junction must equal the current out of the junction.

### 13.1 Voltage and Current

<article>

 

Conductors have an effectively infinite supply of charge, so when they are placed in an electric field, a **separation of charge** occurs. A battery with a potential drop across the ends creates such an electric field; when the ends are connected with a wire, charge will flow across it. The term given to the flow of charge is **electric current**, and it is measured in Amperes (A) --- Coulombs per second. Current is analogous to a river of water, but instead of water flowing, charge does.

**Current** is the number of Coulomb's that flow by per second. Thus 1 Amp of current is equivalent to saying that 1 C of electric charge is passing every second (i.e. the rate of change of charge is 1 C/s).

**[Voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "Voltage")** is the electrical [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") density (energy divided by charge) and differences in this density (voltage) cause electric current in the [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit"). **Batteries** and **power supplies** often provide a voltage difference across the ends of a circuit, but other **voltage sources** exist. Using the water analogy that current is a river, then differences in voltage can be thought of as pipes coming out of a water dam at different heights. The lower the pipe along the dam wall, the larger the water pressure, thus the higher the voltage. If that pipe is connected then current will flow. Current will be larger for the pipe with the greatest pressure (i.e. the lowest pipe on the dam wall).

> ### Key Equation
> 
> $I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$ ; current is the rate at which charge passes by; the units of current are Amperes $(1 \ A = 1 \ C/s)$

#### Example

Somehow, you are able to see the electrons passing through a wire as current flows. Over the course of 5 seconds, you count $1.5*10^{20}$ electrons pass a single point in the wire. How much charge passed you and the current in the wire?

We can use the known charge of an electron to answer the first part of this problem.

$$
\begin{align*}
q&=1.5*10^{20}\:\text{electrons}*1.6*10^{-19}\:\text{C/electron}\\
q&=24\:\text{C}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we use the equation above to determine the current

$$
\begin{align*}
I&=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}\\
I&=\frac{24\:\text{C}}{5\:\text{s}}\\
I&=4.8\:\text{A}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 13.2 Ohm's Law

<article>

 

Ohm's Law is the main equation for electric [circuits](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuits") but it is often misused. In order to calculate the [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") drop across a light bulb use the formula: $V_{lightbulb} = I_{lightbulb}R_{lightbulb}$. For the _total_ current flowing out of the power source, you need the _total_ [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") of the [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") and the _total_ voltage: $V_{total} = I_{total}R_{total}$.

The equations used to calculate the **power** dissipated in a circuit is $P=IV$. As with [Ohm’s Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.5/primary/lesson/resistance-and-ohms-law-phys "Ohm’s Law"), one must be careful not to mix apples with oranges. If you want the power of the entire circuit, then you multiply the _total_ voltage of the power source by the _total_ current coming out of the power source. If you want the power dissipated (i.e. released) by a light bulb, then you multiply the _voltage drop_ across the light bulb by the _current going through that light bulb._

Power is the rate that [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") is released. The units for power are Watts $(W)$, which equal Joules per second $[W] = [J]/[s]$. Therefore, a $60\;\mathrm{W}$ light bulb releases $60$ Joules of energy every second.

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> **Ohm’s Law**
> 
> $V=IR \;$ ; Voltage drop equals current multiplied by resistance.
> 
> **Power**
> 
> $P = IV \;$ ; Power released is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current.







#### Example

A small flash light uses a single AA battery which provides a voltage of 1.5 V. If the bulb has a resistance of $2\;\Omega$, how much power is dissipated by the light bulb.

Since the light bulb is the only object in the circuit, we know the voltage drop across the light bulb is equal to that of the battery. Therefore, we can use Ohm's law to solve for the current in the resistor.

$$
\begin{align*}
V&=IR\\
I&=\frac{V}{R}\\
I&=\frac{1.5\:\text{V}}{2\:\Omega}\\
I&=.75\:\text{A}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can determine the power of the bulb.

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=IV\\
P&=.75\:\text{A}*1.5\:\text{V}\\
P&=1.13\:\text{W}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 13.3 Resistors in Series

<article>

**Resistors in Series**

All resistors are connected end to end. Recall the river analogy: current is analogous to a river of water, but instead of water flowing, charge does. With resistors in series, there is only one river, so there is only one current. But since there is a [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") drop across each resistor, they may all have different voltages across them. The more resistors in series the more rocks in the river, so the less current that flows.

A [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") is wired up with two resistors in series.

![0](media/164.png "Figure 1: Both resistors are in the same ‘river’, so both have the same current flowing through them. Neither resistor has a direct connection to the power supply so neither has 20V across it. But the combined voltages across the individual resistors add up to 20V.")

What is the total [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") of the circuit?

The total resistance is $R_{total}=R_1+R_2=90 \;\Omega+10 \;\Omega=100 \;\Omega$

What is the total current coming out of the power supply?

Use [Ohm’s Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.5/primary/lesson/resistance-and-ohms-law-phys "Ohm’s Law") $(V=IR)$ but solve for current $(I=V/R)$.

$$
I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=\frac{20\:V}{100\:\Omega}=0.20\:A
$$

How much power does the power supply dissipate?

$P=IV$, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, $P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(0.20\;A)(20V)=4.0\;W$. So the Power Supply is outputting 4W (i.e. 4 Joules of [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") per second).

How much power does each resistor dissipate?

Each resistor has different voltage across it, but the same current. So, using Ohm’s law, convert the power formula into a form that does not depend on voltage.

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=IV=I(IR)=I^2R.\\
P_{90 \:\Omega} &= I^2_{90\:\Omega}R_{90\:\Omega}=(0.2\:A)^2(90\:\Omega)=3.6\:W\\
P_{10 \:\Omega} &= I^2_{10\:\Omega}R_{10\:\Omega}=(0.2\:A)^2(10\:\Omega)=0.4\:W
\end{align*}
$$

$^*$Note: If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.

How much voltage is there across each resistor?

In order to calculate voltage across a resistor, use Ohm’s law.

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{90\:\Omega} &= I_{90\:\Omega}R_{90\:\Omega}=(0.2\:A)(90\:\Omega)=18\:V\\
V_{10\:\Omega} &= I_{10\:\Omega}R_{10\:\Omega}=(0.2\:A)(10\:\Omega)=2\:V
\end{align*}
$$

$^*$Note: If you add up the voltages across the individual resistors you will obtain the total voltage of the circuit, as you should. Further note that with the voltages we can use the original form of the Power equation $(P=IV)$, and we should get the same results as above.

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{90\:\Omega} &= I_{90\:\Omega}V_{90\:\Omega}=(18\:V)(0.2\:A)=3.6\:W\\
P_{10\:\Omega} &= I_{10\:\Omega}V_{10\:\Omega}=(2.0\:V)(0.2\:A)=0.4\:W
\end{align*}
$$

### 13.4 Resistors in Parallel

<article>

 

#### Resistors in Parallel

All resistors are connected together at both ends. Recall the river analogy: current is analogous to a river of water, but instead of water flowing, charge does. With resistors in parallel, there are many rivers (i.e. the main river branches off into many other rivers), so all resistors receive different amounts of current. But since they are all connected to the same point at both ends they all receive the same [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage").

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> $$
> \frac{1} {R_{total}} = \frac{1} {R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1} {R_3} + \ldots
> $$

#### Example

A [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") is wired up with 2 resistors in parallel.

![0](media/167.png "Figure 1: Both resistors are directly connected to the power supply, so both have the same 20V across them. But they are on different ‘rivers’ so they have different current flowing through them. Lets go through the same questions and answers as with the circuit in series.")

What is the total [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") of the circuit?

The total resistance is $\frac{1}{R_{total}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}=\frac{1}{90\Omega}+\frac{1}{10\Omega}=\frac{1}{90\Omega}+\frac{9}{90\Omega}=\frac{10}{90\Omega}$ thus, $R_{total}=\frac{90\Omega}{10}=9\Omega$

$^*$Note: Total resistance for a circuit in parallel will always be smaller than smallest resistor in the circuit.

What is the total current coming out of the power supply?

Use [Ohm’s Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.5/primary/lesson/resistance-and-ohms-law-phys "Ohm’s Law") $(V=IR)$ but solve for current $(I=V/R)$.

$$
I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=\frac{20V}{9\Omega}=2.2A
$$

How much power does the power supply dissipate?

$P=IV$, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, $P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(2.2A)(20V)=44.4W$. So the Power Supply outputs 44W (i.e. 44 Joules of [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") per second).

How much power is each resistor dissipating?

Each resistor has different current across it, but the same voltage. So, using Ohm’s law, convert the power formula into a form that does not depend on current. $P=IV=\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) V=\frac{V^2}{R}$ Substituted $I=V/R$ into the power formula. $P_{90\Omega}=\frac{V^2_{90\Omega}}{R_{90\Omega}}=\frac{(20V)^2}{90\Omega}=4.4W; P_{10\Omega}=\frac{V^2_{10\Omega}}{R_{10}\Omega}=\frac{(20V)^2}{10\Omega}=40W$

$^*$Note: If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.

How much current is flowing through each resistor?

Use Ohm’s law to calculate the current for each resistor.

$$
I_{90\Omega}=\frac{V_{90\Omega}}{R_{90\Omega}}=\frac{20V}{90\Omega}=0.22A \qquad I_{10\Omega}=\frac{V_{10\Omega}}{R_{10\Omega}}=\frac{20V}{10\Omega}=2.0A
$$

Notice that the $10\Omega$ resistor has the most current going through it. It has the least resistance to electricity so this makes sense.

$^*$Note: If you add up the currents of the individual ‘rivers’ you get the total current of the of the circuit, as you should.

#### Example

A more complicated [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") is analyzed.

![0](media/173.png "Figure 4: a. What is the total resistance of the circuit?")

In order to find the total resistance we do it in steps (see pictures. First add the $90 \Omega$ and $10\Omega$ in series to make one equivalent resistance of $100\Omega$ (see diagram at below). Then add the $100\Omega$ to the $10\Omega$ in parallel to get one resistor of $9.1\Omega$. Now we have two resistors in series, simply add them to get the total resistance of $29.1\Omega$.

![0](media/174.png "Figure 5: ![0](media/175.png)")

\[Figure 6\]

![0](media/176.png "Figure 7: b. What is the total current coming out of the power supply?")

Use [Ohm’s Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.5/primary/lesson/resistance-and-ohms-law-phys "Ohm’s Law") $(V=IR)$ but solve for current $(I=V/R)$. $I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=20V/2.91\Omega=0.69\ Amps$

c. What is the power dissipated by the power supply?

$P=IV$, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, $P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(0.69A)(20V)=13.8W$.

d. How much power is the $20\Omega$ resistor dissipating?

The $20\Omega$ has the full 0.69Amps running through it because it is part of the ‘main river’ (this is not the case for the other resistors because the current splits). $P_{20 \Omega} = I^2_{20 \Omega} R_{20 \Omega} = (0.69A)^2 (20 \Omega) = 9.5W$

e. If these resistors are light bulbs, order them from brightest to least bright.

The brightness of a light bulb is directly given by the power dissipated. So we could go through each resistor as we did the $20\Omega$ guy and calculate the power then simply order them. But, we can also think it out. For the guys in parallel the current splits with most of the current going through the $10\Omega$ path (less resistance) and less going through the $90\Omega+10\Omega$ path. Well the second path is ten times the resistance of the first, so it will have one tenth of the total current. Thus, there is approximately and 0.069 Amps going through the $90\Omega$ and $10\Omega$ path and 0.621Amps going through the $10\Omega$ path.

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{10 \Omega} &= I^2_{10\Omega}R_{10 \Omega}=(0.621A)^2(10\Omega)=3.8W\\
P_{90+10\Omega} &= I^2_{90+10\Omega}R_{90 + 10 \Omega}=(0.069A)^2(100\Omega)=0.5W
\end{align*}
$$

We now know that the $20\Omega$ is the brightest, $10\Omega$ is second and then the $90\Omega$ and last the $10\Omega$ (-these last two have same current flowing through them, so $90\Omega$ is brighter due to its higher resistance).

$^*$Note: Adding up these two plus the 9.5W from the $20\Omega$ resistor gives us 13.8W, which is the total power previously calculated, so we have confidence everything is good.

### 13.6 Energy Efficiency

<article>

 

#### Conservation of Energy and Electrical Efficiency

Electrical [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") is useful to us mostly because it is easy to transport and can be easily converted to or from other [forms of energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.4/primary/lesson/forms-of-energy-ms-ps "forms of energy"). Of course, conversion involves waste, typically as [heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "heat").

Electrical energy consumed can be determined by multiplying power by time $(E = P \Delta t)$. Recall the equations for mechanical and thermal energy/work $(PE=mgh, KE=1/2mv^2, Q=mc \Delta T)$. An important idea is the _[efficiency](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/13.5/primary/lesson/efficiency-ms-ps "efficiency")_ of an electrical device: the fraction of electrical energy consumed that goes into doing useful work $(E_{out}/E_{in})$, expressed as a percentage.

#### Example 

You use a 100 W [electric motor](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/19.3/primary/lesson/electric-motors-phys "electric motor") to lift a 10 kg mass 5 m, and it takes 20 s.

The electrical energy consumed is $E_{elec} = P \cdot t = (100 \ W) (20 \ s) = 2000 \ J$

The work done is against gravity, so we use $PE = mgh = (10 \ kg) (10 \ m/s^2) (5 \ m) = 500 \ J$

The efficiency is $E_{out}/E_{in} = (500 \ J) / (2000 \ J) = 0.25 = 25. \ \text{efficient}$

### 13.7 Internal Resistance

<article>

A battery is a [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") source. A battery can be thought of as a perfect voltage source with a small resistor (called internal resistance) in series. The electric [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") density produced by the chemistry of the battery is called **emf,** but the amount of voltage available from the battery is called **terminal voltage.** The terminal voltage equals the emf minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance (current of the external [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") times the internal resistance). In practice, if you short circuit a battery and measure its voltage you will see the voltage is less than what is marked on it and what it can produce when outputting smaller currents. The short circuit of the battery, makes it pump out a lot of current and then the voltage drop over the internal resistance gets large ( **V = Ir** ) which in turn reduces the terminal voltage.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $V_{terminal} = emf - Ir$
> 
> The terminal voltage (or 'output voltage') is equal to the emf (it's 'ideal voltage') minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance.

#### Example

You have a battery with an emf of 5 V and an unknown internal resistance. You hook the battery up to a circuit with one $3\;\Omega$ resistor and measure the current through the resistor to be 1.5 A. What is the internal resistance of the batter and how much power is the battery's [resistance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.8/primary/lesson/electric-resistance-ms-ps "resistance") dissipating.

To start this problem we'll first find the terminal voltage of the battery using the information we know about the resistor. We know the voltage drop across the resistor must be equal to the terminal voltage because there the total change in voltage must be over the whole circuit.

## 14.0 Magnetism

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/186.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

For static electric charges, the electromagnetic force is manifested by the Coulomb electric force alone. If charges are moving, an additional force emerges, called magnetism. The $19^{th}$ century realization that electricity and magnetism are dual aspects of the same force completely changed our understanding of the world we live in. Insights due to Ampere, Gauss, and Maxwell led to the understanding that moving charges – electric currents – create magnetic fields. Varying magnetic fields create electric fields. Thus a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field will have current induced in it. This is called _electromagnetic induction._ Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter $B$ and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla.

### 14.1 Magnetic Fields

<article>

 

Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter B and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla. Permanent magnets (like refrigerator magnets) consist of atoms, such as iron, for which the magnetic moments (roughly electron spin) of the electrons are “lined up” all across the atom. This means that their magnetic fields add up, rather than canceling each other out. The net effect is noticeable because so many atoms have lined up. The magnetic field of such a [magnet](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/18.1/primary/lesson/properties-of-magnets-phys "magnet") always points from the north pole to the south. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, for example, is illustrated below:

![0](media/187.png "Figure 1: If we were to cut the magnet above in half, it would still have north and south poles; the resulting magnetic field would be qualitatively the same as the one above (but weaker).")

Charged particles in motion also generate magnetic fields. The most frequently used example is a current carrying wire, since current is literally moving charged particles. The magnitude of a field generated by a wire depends on [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") to the wire and strength of the current $(I)$ (see 'Key Equations' section) :

Meanwhile, its direction can be found using the so called **first right hand rule**: point your thumb in the direction of the current. Then, curl your fingers around the wire. The direction your fingers will point in the same direction as the field. Be sure to use your right hand!

![0](media/188.png "Figure 2: Sometimes, it is necessary to represent such three dimensional fields on a two dimensional sheet of paper. The following example illustrates how this is done.")

![0](media/189.png "Figure 3: In the example above, a current is running along a wire towards the top of your page. The magnetic field is circling the current carrying wire in loops which are perpendicular to the page. Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, _we use the symbol $\bigodot$ to represent where the magnetic field is coming_ **_out of the page_** _and the symbol $\bigotimes$ to represent where the magnetic field is going_ **_into the page_**_._ This convention can be used for all vector quantities: fields, forces, velocities, etc.")

#### Example

You are standing right next to a current carrying wire and decide to throw your magnetic field sensor some distance perpendicular to the wire. When you go to retrieve your sensor, it shows the magnetic field where it landed to be $4*10^{-5}\;\text{T}$. If you know the wire was carrying 300A, how far did you throw the sensor?

To solve this problem, we will just use the equation given above and solve for the radius.

$$
\begin{align*}
B&=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi r}\\
r&=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi B}\\
r&=\frac{4\pi*10^{-7}\:\text{Tm/A}* 300\:\text{A}}{2\pi* 4*10^{-5}\:\text{T}}\\
r&=1.5\:\text{m}\\

### 14.2 Lorentz Force

<article>

 

As moving charges create magnetic fields, so they experience forces from magnetic fields generated by other materials. The magnitude of the force experienced by a particle traveling in a [magnetic field](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/18.2/primary/lesson/electric-currents-and-magnetic-fields-phys "magnetic field") depends on the charge of the particle $(q)$, the [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity") of the particle $(v)$, the strength of the field $(B)$, and, importantly, the angle between their relative directions $(\theta)$:

There is a **second right hand rule** that will show the direction of the force on a positive charge in a magnetic field: point your index finger along the direction of the particle’s velocity . If your middle finger points along the magnetic field, your thumb will point in the direction of the force. NOTE: For negative charge reverse the direction of the force (or use your left hand)

![0](media/191.png "Figure 1: For instance, if a positively charged particle is moving to the right, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going out of the page, while if a positively charged particle is moving to the left, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going into the page:")

#### Example 1: Find the Magnetic Field

An electron is moving to the east at a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of $1.8\times10^6\;\mathrm{m/s}$. It feels a force in the upward direction with a magnitude of $2.2\times10^{-12}\;\mathrm{N}$. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field this electron just passed through?

There are two parts to this question, the magnitude of the electric field and the direction. We will first focus on the magnitude.

To find the magnitude we will use the equation 

$$
F_B=qvBsin\theta
$$

 We were given the force of the magnetic field $(2.2\times10^{-12}\;\mathrm{N})$ and the velocity that the electron is traveling $(1.8\times10^6\;\mathrm{m/s})$. We also know the charge of the electron $(1.6\times10^{-19}\;\mathrm{C})$. Also, because the electron's velocity is perpendicular to the field, we do not have to deal with $\sin\theta$ because $\sin\theta$ of $90$ degrees is $1$. Therefore all we have to do is solve for B and plug in the known values to get the answer.

$$
F_B=qvB\sin\theta
$$

Solving for B:

$$
B = \frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}
$$

 

Now, plugging the known values we have:

$$
B=\frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}=\frac{2.2?10^{-12}\:\mathrm{N}}{1.6\times10^{-19}\:\mathrm{C} \times 1.8\times10^6\:\mathrm{m/s}\times1}=7.6\:\mathrm{T}
$$

Now we will find the direction of the field. We know the direction of the velocity (east) and the direction of the force due to the magnetic field (up, out of the page). Therefore we can use the second right hand rule (we will use the left hand, since an electron's charge is negative). Point the pointer finger to the right to represent the velocity and the thumb up to represent the force. This forces the middle finger, which represents the direction of the magnetic field, to point south. Alternatively, we could recognize that this situation is illustrated for a _positive_ particle in the right half of the drawing above; for a negative particle to experience the same force, the field has to point in the opposite direction: south.

#### Example 2: Circular Motion in Magnetic Fields

Consider the following problem: a positively charged particle with an initial velocity of $\vec{v}_1$, charge $q$ and mass $m$ traveling in the plane of this page enters a region with a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}$  pointing into the page. We are interested in finding the trajectory of this particle.

![0](media/193.png "Figure 3: Since the force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is always perpendicular to both its velocity vector and the field vector (check this using the second right hand rule above), a _constant_ magnetic field will provide a [centripetal force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/5.2/primary/lesson/centripetal-force-phys "centripetal force") --- that is, a constant force that is always directed perpendicular to the direction of motion. Two such force/velocity combinations are illustrated above. According to our study of rotational motion, this implies that as long as the particle does not leave the region of the magnetic field, it will travel in a circle. To find the radius of the circle, we set the magnitude of the centripetal force equal to the magnitude of the magnetic force and solve for $r$:")

$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = F_B = qvB\sin \theta = qvB
$$

Therefore,

$$
r = \frac{mv^2}{qvB}
$$

 In the examples above, $\theta$ was conveniently 90 degrees, which made $\sin \theta = 1$. But that does not really matter; in a constant magnetic fields a different $\theta$ will simply decrease the force by a constant factor and will not change the qualitative behavior of the particle.

#### Force on a Wire

Since a wire is nothing but a collection of moving charges, the force it will experience in a [magnetic field](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/18.2/primary/lesson/electric-currents-and-magnetic-fields-phys "magnetic field") will simply be the vector sum of the forces on the individual charges. If the wire is straight --- that is, all the charges are moving in the same direction --- these forces will all point in the same direction, and so will their sum. Then, the direction of the force can be found using the second right hand rule, while its magnitude will depend on the length of the wire (denoted $L$), the strength of the current, the strength of the field, and the angle between their directions:

Two current-carrying wires next to each other each generate magnetic fields and therefore exert forces on each other:

Example

A wire loop and an infinitely long current carrying cable are placed a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") $r$ apart. The infinitely long wire is carrying a current $I_1$ to the left and the loop is carrying a current $I_2$ CCW. The dimensions of the wire loop are shown in the diagram illustrating the situation below. What is the magnitude and direction of the net force on the loop (the mass of the wires are negligible)?

![0](media/196.png "Figure 2: In this problem, it is best to start by determining the direction of the force on each segment of the loop. Based on the first right hand rule, the magnetic field from the infinite cable points into the page where the loop is. This means that the force on the top segment of the loop will be down toward the bottom of the page, the force on the left segment will be to right, the force on the bottom segment will be toward the top of the page, and the force on the right segment will be to the left. The forces on the left and right segments will balance out because both segments are the same distance from the cable. The forces from the top and bottom section will not balance out because the wires are different distances from the cable. The force on the bottom segment will be stronger than the one on the top segment because the magnetic field is stronger closer to the cable, so the net force on the loop will be up, toward the top of the page.")

Now we will begin to calculate the force's magnitude by first determining the strength of the magnetic field at the bottom and top segments. All we really have to do is plug in the distances to each segment into the equation we already know for the magnetic field due to a current carrying wire.

$$
\begin{align*}
B&=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi r}\\
B_{bottom}&=\frac{\mu_oI_1}{2\pi R}\\
B_{top}&=\frac{\mu_oI_1}{2\pi 2R}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we will calculate the net force on the loop using the equation given above. We'll consider up the positive direction.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma F&=F_{bottom} - F_{top} && \text{start by summing the forces on the loop}\\
\Sigma F&=I_2LB_{bottom} - I_2LB_{top} && \text{substitute in the values for each of the force terms}\\
\Sigma F&=I_2L(B_{bottom} - B_{top}) && \text{factor the equation}\\
\Sigma F&=I_2L(\frac{\mu_oI_1}{2\pi R} - \frac{\mu_oI_1}{2\pi 2R}) && \text{substitute in the values for the magnetic field}\\
\Sigma F&=\frac{\mu_oI_1I_2L}{2\pi R}(1-\frac{1}{2}) && \text{factor the equation again}\\
\Sigma F&=\frac{\mu_oI_1I_2L}{4\pi R} && \text{simplify to get the answer}\\
\end{align*}

### 14.4 Electromagnetic Induction

<article>

 

To understand induction, we need to introduce the concept of **electromagnetic flux**. If you have a closed, looped wire of area $A$ (measured in $\mathrm{m^2}$) and $N$ loops, and you pass a [magnetic field](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/18.2/primary/lesson/electric-currents-and-magnetic-fields-phys "magnetic field") $B$ through, the magnetic flux $\Phi$ is given by the formula below. Again, the relative direction of the loops and the field matter; this relationship is preserved by creating an 'area vector': a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The directions' influence can then be conveniently captured through a dot product: 

$$
\begin{align*}
\Phi = N \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} &&\text{ Electromagnetic Flux}
\end{align*}
$$

The units of magnetic flux are $\text{T} \times \mathrm{m^2}$, also known as **Webers**$\text{(Wb)}$.

![0](media/199.png "Figure 1: In the example above, there are four loops of wire $(N = 4)$ and each has area $\pi r^2$ (horizontally hashed). The magnetic field is pointing at an angle $\theta$ to the area vector. If the magnetic field has magnitude $B$, the flux through the loops will equal $4 \cos \theta B \pi r^2$. Think of the magnetic flux as the part of the “bundle” of magnetic field lines “held” by the loop that points along the area vector.")

If the magnetic flux through a loop or loops changes, electrons in the wire will feel a force, and this will generate a current. The _induced [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage")_ (also called **[electromotive force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/19.2/primary/lesson/electromotive-force-phys "electromotive force"), or emf**) that they feel is equal to the change in flux $\triangle \Phi$ divided by the amount of time $\triangle t$ that change took. This relationship is called Faraday’s Law of Induction: 

$$
\begin{align*}
emf = -\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}&& \text{Faraday's Law of Induction}
\end{align*}
$$

The direction of the induced current is determined as follows: the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that _opposes_ the change in flux. This is called Lenz’s Law. Note that the electromotive force described above is not actually a force, since it is measured in Volts and acts like an induced potential difference. It was originally called that since it caused charged particles to move --- hence _electromotive_ --- and the name stuck (it's somewhat analogous to calling an increase in a particle's gravitational [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy") difference a gravitomotive force). For practical ([Ohm's Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.5/primary/lesson/resistance-and-ohms-law-phys "Ohm's Law"), etc) purposes it can be treated like the voltage from a battery.

Since only a changing flux can produce an induced potential difference, one or more of the variables in equation \[5. must be changing if the ammeter in the picture above is to register any current. Specifically, the following can all induce a current in the loops of wire:

* Changing the direction or magnitude of the magnetic field.
* Changing the loops' orientation or area.
* Moving the loops out of the region with the magnetic field.

#### Example

You are dragging a circular loop of wire of radius .25 m across a table at a [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of 2 m/s. There is a 2 m long region of the table where there is a constant magnetic field of magnitude 5 T pointed out of the table. As you drag the loop across the table, what will be the induced Emf (a) as the loop enters the field (b) while it is in the field and (c) as it exits the field.

(a): As the loop enters the field, the flux will start at zero and begin to increase until the loop is entirely inside the field. The flux will increase from 0 Tm_2_ to some maximum value in the time it takes for the loop to move into the field. We can find this maximum value using the dimensions of the loop and the strength of the magnetic field. The dot product will be equal to one since the area and magnetic field [vectors](/c/physics/vectors "vectors") are parallel.

$$
\begin{align*}
\Phi_f&=NBA\\
\Phi_f&=1*5\:\text{T} * \pi (.25\:\text{m})^2\\
\Phi_f&=.98\:\text{Tm}^2\\
\end{align*}
$$

Since we also know the radius of the loop and the speed at which it is being pulled, we also can find out how long it will take for the loop to move within the magnetic field.

$$
\begin{align*}
d&=vt\\
t&=\frac{d}{v}\\
t&=\frac{2*.25\:\text{m}}{2\:\text{m/s}}\\
t&=.25\:\text{s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can find the induced Emf in the loop.

$$
\begin{align*}
Emf&=\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}\\
Emf&=\frac{.98\:\text{Tm}^2 - 0\:\text{Tm}^2}{.25\:\text{s}}\\
Emf&=3.92\:\text{V}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): There will be no inuduced Emf in the loop once the entire loop is inside the magnetic field because the magnetic flux will not be changing.

(c): As the loop exits the magnetic field, the induced Emf will have the same magntiude as when it entered the field except that this time it will be negative because the flux is decreasing.

$$
\begin{align*}
Emf&=-3.92\:\text{V}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### Review

1. A speaker consists of a diaphragm (a flat plate), which is attached to a magnet. A coil of wire surrounds the magnet. How can an electrical current be transformed into sound? Why is a coil better than a single loop? If you want to make music, what should you do to the current?

### 14.5 Generators and Motors

<article>

Changing magnetic fields passing through a loop of wire generate currents in that wire; this is how electric power generators work. Likewise, a changing current in a wire will create a changing [magnetic field](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/18.2/primary/lesson/electric-currents-and-magnetic-fields-phys "magnetic field"); this is how speakers and electric motors work.

Since only a changing flux can produce an induced potential difference, one or more of the variables in the equation must be changing if any _emf_ is to be produced. Specifically, the following can all induce a current in the loops of wire:

* Changing the direction or magnitude of the magnetic field.
* Changing the loops' orientation or area.
* Moving the loops out of the region with the magnetic field.

The direction of the induced current is determined as follows: the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that _opposes_ the change in flux. This is called Lenz’s Law. Note that the [electromotive force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/19.2/primary/lesson/electromotive-force-phys "electromotive force") described above is not actually a force, since it is measured in Volts and acts like an induced potential difference.

#### Example

To create a simple generator, you are holding a single coil of wire in place on a table. You hold a bar [magnet](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/18.1/primary/lesson/properties-of-magnets-phys "magnet") directly above the center of the wire and move it toward the wire and away from the wire repeatedly to create a current in loop. (a) As you bring the bar magnet toward the loop, which direction does the current flow? (b) As you move the magnet away from the loop, which direction does the current flow?

(a): As you bring the magnet closer to the loop, the magnetic field will increase in strength thus increasing the magnetic flux going into the table through the loop. In order to oppose this change in flux, the induced current will need to create a magnetic field that will point out of the table through the loop. We can use the first right hand rule, starting with the direction of them magnetic field instead of the direction of the current, to determine that the current will need to move in the CCW direction.

(b): When you move the magnet away from the loop, the magnetic field will be decreasing thus decreasing the magnetic flux going into the table through the loop. The induced current will need to create a magnetic field that is also pointed into the table through the loop to oppose this change in flux. Again, we use the second right hand rule to find that the current must go in the CW direction.

## 15.0 Electric Circuits: Capacitors

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/202.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

When current flows through wires and resistors in a circuit as a result of a difference in electric potential, charge does not build up significantly anywhere on its path. Capacitors are devices placed in electric circuits where charge _can_ build up. The amount of charge a capacitor can store before it “fills up” depends on its shape and how much electric potential is applied. The ratio of charge stored in a capacitor to the voltage applied is called its _capacitance_, measured in Farads $(F)$. The larger the electric potential in volts, the stronger the electric field that is used to “cram” the charge into the device. Any capacitor will fill up with enough charge. Capacitors store energy when charged, and release it when they discharge.



</article>

### 15.1 Capacitors

<article>

 

A capacitor is a device that stores charge. It is typically two very large flat plates wrapped in a cylinder with a dielectric substance in between the two. The dielectric allows the plates to be at a high [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") (and thus store more charge) without arcing between them. The capacitance, literally tells you how much charge it can hold. The capacitance of a capacitor only depends on its geometry. Here some important things to keep in mind in regards to capacitors:

* $Q$ refers to the amount of positive charge stored on the high voltage side of the capacitor; an equal and opposite amount, $-Q$, of negative charge is stored on the low voltage side of the capacitor.

* Current can flow _into_ a capacitor from either side, but current doesn’t flow across the capacitor from one plate to another. The plates do not touch, and the substance in between is insulating, not conducting.

* One side of the capacitor fills up with negative charge, and the other fills up with positive charge. The reason for the thin, close plates is so that you can use the negative charge on one plate to attract and hold the positive charge on the other plate. The reason for the plates with large areas is so that you can spread out the charge on one plate so that its self-repulsion doesn’t stop you from filling it with more charge.

* Typical dielectric constants κ are roughly 5.6 for glass and 80 for water. What these “dielectric” substances do is align their electric polarity with the electric field in a capacitor (much like atoms in a magnetic material) and, in doing so, reduces the electric field for a given amount of charge. Thereby allowing for more charge to be stored for a given Voltage.

* The electrical [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") symbol for a capacitor is two flat plates, mimicking the geometry of a capacitor, which typically consists of two flat plates separated by a small [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance"). The plates are normally wrapped around several times to form a cylindrical shape.

#### Example

You create a simple capacitor by placing two .25m square metal plates .01m apart and then connecting each plate to one end of a battery. (a) If the battery can create a voltage drop of 12V, how much charge can be stored in the capacitor. (b) If you immersed the whole system in water, how much more charge could you store on the capacitor?

(a): To solve this problem, we can use the equations give above. First we'll find the capacitance of the two plates based on their dimensions. Since there is not dielectric between the plates to start, the dielectric constant is 1.

$$
\begin{align*}
C&=\frac{\kappa \epsilon_o A}{d}\\
C&=\frac{1*8.85*10^{-12}\:\text{F/m} * (.25\:\text{m})^2}{.01\:\text{m}}\\
C&=5.5*10^{-11}\:\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can find out how much charge can be stored on the capacitor.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q&=CV\\
Q&=5.5*10^{-11}\:\text{F} * 12\:\text{V}\\
Q&=6.63*10^{-10}\:\text{C}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): The new capacitance will just be 80x the original capacitance because that is the dielectric constant of water. We can use this to calculate how much charge can be stored on the submerged capacitor.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q&=80CV\\
Q&=80*5.5*10^{-11}\:\text{F} * 12\:\text{V}\\
Q&=5.31*10^{-8}\:\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

As you can see, the capacitance of these plates is pretty small. Most capacitors have very thin, but very long metal sheets that are rolled up into a cylinder and separated by only a few millimeters; this provides a much greater capacitance in a much smaller volume.

### 15.2 Capacitor Energy

<article>

Suppose we have two parallel metal plates set a [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") $d$ from one another. We place a positive charge on one of the plates and a negative charge on the other. In this configuration, there will be a uniform electric field between the plates pointing from, and normal to, the plate carrying the positive charge. The magnitude of this field is given by 

$$
E = \frac{V}{d}
$$

 where V is the potential difference (voltage) between the two plates.

The amount of charge, $Q$, held by each plate is given by 

$$
Q = CV
$$

 where again $V$ is the [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") difference between the plates and $C$ is the capacitance of the plate configuration. Capacitance can be thought of as the capacity a device has for storing charge . In the parallel plate case the capacitance is given by 

$$
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
$$

 where $A$ is the area of the plates, $d$ is the distance between the plates, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space whose value is $8.84 \times 10^{-12} C/V \cdot m$.

The electric field between the capacitor plates stores [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy").

Where does this energy come from? Recall, that in our preliminary discussion of electric forces we assert that "like charges repel one another". To build our initial configuration we had to place an excess of positive and negative charges, respectively, on each of the metal plates. Forcing these charges together on the plate had to overcome the mutual repulsion that the charges experience; this takes work. The energy used in moving the charges onto the plates gets stored in the field between the plates. It is in this way that the capacitor can be thought of as an energy storage device. This property will become more important when we study [capacitors](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/17.6/primary/lesson/the-capacitor-phys "capacitors") in the context of electric [circuits](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuits") in the next several Concepts.

Note: Many home-electronic circuits include capacitors; for this reason, it can be dangerous to mess around with old electronic components, as the capacitors may be charged even if the unit is unplugged. For example, old computer monitors (not flat screens) and TVs have capacitors that hold dangerous amounts of charge hours after the power is turned off.

> ###   Key Equations
> 
>  The electric [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy"), $U_{\text{C}}$, stored in the capacitor is given by
> 
> $$
> U_{\text{C}} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2
> $$

#### Example

You have a capacitor with capacitance $100\text{nF}$. If you connected it to a 12V battery, how much energy is stored in the capacitor when it is fully charged? If you were to submerge this capacitor in water, how much energy could be stored in it?

We'll just use the equation given above to calculate the energy stored on the capacitor.

$$
\begin{align*}
U_c&=\frac{1}{2}CV^2\\
U_c&=\frac{1}{2}100*10^{-9}\:\text{F}*12\:\text{V}\\
U_c&=6*10^{-7}\:\text{J}\\
\end{align*}
$$

By adding a dielectric, we increase the capacitance of the capacitor by a factor of the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant of water is 80, so the new capacitance will be 80 times the original capacitance.

$$
\begin{align*}
U_c&=\frac{1}{2}80CV^2\\
U_c&=\frac{1}{2}80*100*10^{-9}\:\text{F}*12\:\text{V}\\
U_c&=4.8*10^{-5}\:\text{J}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Capacitors in series have the same charge stored, but different voltages. Remember that if a capacitor are hooked up to the battery they will have the same voltage as the battery. If the capacitor is unhooked from a battery and other capacitors are attached to it, then the voltage can change but the total amount of charge must remain constant. Charge conservation holds that charge can not be created or destroyed. When solving problems involving [capacitor circuits](/c/physics/capacitor-circuits "capacitor circuits"), we use the equation for the charge on a capacitor much like we use [Ohm's Law](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.5/primary/lesson/resistance-and-ohms-law-phys "Ohm's Law").

#### Example 1

Two capacitors, one of $10;\mu\text{F}$ ($C_1$) and one of $60\;\mu\text{F}$ ($C_2$), are connected to a 10V battery in series. A diagram of the [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") is shown below. Determine (a) the total capacitance, (b) the charge stored on the $100\;\mu\text{F}$ capacitor, and (c) the voltage drop across the $60\;\mu\text{F}$.

![0](media/205.png "Figure 1: (a): To find the total capacitance, we'll use the equation give above for determining the equivalent capacitance of capacitors in series.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{C_{total}}&=\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}\\
\frac{1}{C_{total}}&=\frac{1}{100\:\mu\text{F}} + \frac{1}{60\:\mu\text{F}}\\
C_{total}&=37.5\:\mu\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): Since charge is the same across capacitors in series, we can use the charge found using the total capacitance and the total voltage drop to find the charge in the $C_1$ capacitor.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q&=C_{total}V\\
Q&=37.5\:\mu\text{F} * 10\;\text{V}\\
Q&=375\:\mu\text{C}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(c): Since we know the charge and the capacitance of $C_2$, we can find the voltage drop.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q&=C_2V_2\\
V_2&=\frac{Q}{C_2}\\
V_2&=\frac{375\:\mu\text{C}}{60\:\mu\text{F}}\\
V_2&=6.2\:\text{V}\\
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 2

The two capacitors used in the previous example problem are now connected to the battery in parallel. What is (a) the total capacitance and (b) the charge on $C_1$. A diagram of the circuit is shown below.

![0](media/206.png "Figure 2: (a): To find the total capacitance, we'll us the equation given above for capacitors in parallel.")

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{total}&=C_1+C_2\\
C_{total}&=100\:\mu\text{F} + 60\:\mu\text{F}\\
C_{total}&=160\:\mu\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): Now, since the voltage across capacitors in parallel is equal, we can find the charge on $C_2$.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q_2&=C_2V\\
Q_2&=60\:\mu\text{F} * 10\:\text{V}\\
Q_2&=600\:\mu\text{C}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 15.4 RC Time Constant

<article>

When a capacitor is initially uncharged, it is very easy to stuff charge in. As charge builds, it repels new charge with more and more force. Due to this effect, the charging of a capacitor follows a logarithmic curve. When you pass current through a resistor into a capacitor, the capacitor eventually “fills up” and no more current flows. A typical RC [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit") is shown below; when the switch is closed, the capacitor discharges with an exponentially decreasing current.

![0](media/208.png "Figure 1: #### Example")

In the circuit diagram shown above, the resistor has a value of $100\;\Omega$ and the capacitor has a capacitance of $500\;\mu\text{F}$. After the switched is closed, (a) how long will it be until the charge on the capacitor is only 10% of what it was when the switch was originally closed? If the capacitor was originally charged by a 12 V battery, how much charge will be left on it at this time?

(a): To solve the first part of the problem, we'll use the equation that gives charge as a function of time.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q(t)&=Q_oe^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} && \text{start with the equation give above}\\
.1Q_o&=Q_oe^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} && \text{substitute } .1Q_o \text{ for } Q(t) \text{ because that's the charge at the time we want to find}\\
.1&=e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} && \text{simplify the equation}\\
t&=-\tau\ln(.1) && \text{solve for time}\\
t&=-RC\ln(.1) && \text{substitute in the value for } \tau\\
t&=-100\;\Omega * 500\;\mu\text{F} * \ln(.1) && \text{substitute in all the known values}\\
t&=.12\;\text{s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): Solving the second part of this problem will be a two step process. We will use the capacitance and the [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") drop to determine how much charge was originally on the capacitor ($Q_o$).

$$
\begin{align*}
Q_o&=CV\\
Q_o&=500\;\mu\text{F} * 12\;\text{V}\\
Q_o&=.006\;\text{C}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we can plug in the time we found in part A to the equation for charge as a function of time.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q(t)&=Q_oe^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}\\
Q(.12\;\text{s})&=.006\;\text{C}e^{\frac{-.12\;\text{s}}{100\;\Omega * 500\;\mu\text{F}}}\\
Q(.12\;\text{s})&=5.44*10^{-4}\;\text{C}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 15.5 Capacitors Circuits

<article>

When a capacitor is placed in a [circuit](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/20.11/primary/lesson/electric-circuits-ms-ps "circuit"), current does not actually travel across it. Rather, equal and opposite charge begins to build up on opposite sides of the capacitor --- mimicking a current --- until the electric field in the capacitor creates a potential difference across it that balances the [voltage](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/16.1/primary/lesson/the-electric-potential-in-a-uniform-field-phys "voltage") drop across any parallel resistors or the voltage source itself (if there are no resistors in parallel with the capacitor). The ratio of charge on a capacitor to potential difference across it is called capacitance.

It is important to break down a complicated circuit into the equivalent capacitance using the rules for [capacitors](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/17.6/primary/lesson/the-capacitor-phys "capacitors") in series and capacitors in parallel. Also remember that capacitors in parallel have the same voltage while capacitors in series have the same charge.

#### Example

In the circuit shown below, determine (a) the total capacitance and (b) the total charge stored.

![0](media/210.png "Figure 1: (a): In solving this problem, we'll call the $20\;\mu\text{F}$ capacitor $C_1$, the $60\;\mu\text{F}$ capacitor $C_2$, the $40\;\mu\text{F}$ capacitor $C_3$, and the $100\;\mu\text{F}$ capacitor $C_4$.")

Our first step will be to find the equivalent capacitance of $C_2$ and $C_3$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{C_{2,3}}&=\frac{1}{C_2}+\frac{1}{C_3}\\
\frac{1}{C_{2,3}}&=\frac{1}{60\;\mu\text{F}} + \frac{1}{40\;\mu\text{F}}\\
\frac{1}{C_{2,3}}&=\frac{5}{120\;\mu\text{F}}\\
C_{2,3}&=24\;\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Next, we'll combine the capacitance of $C_{2,3}$ and $C_4$.

$$
\begin{align*}
C_{2,3,4}&=C_{2,3} + C_4\\
C_{2,3,4}&=24\;\mu\text{F} + 100\;\mu\text{F}\\ 
C_{2,3,4}&=124\;\mu\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, we can combine $C_{2,3,4}$ with $C_1$ to find the total capacitance.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{C_{eq}}&=\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_{2,3,4}}\\
\frac{1}{C_{eq}}&=\frac{1}{20\;\mu\text{F}} + \frac{1}{124\;\mu\text{F}}\\
\frac{1}{C_{eq}}&=.058\;\mu\text{F}^{-1}\\
C_{eq}&=17.22\;\mu\text{F}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): Now we can use this value to find the total charge stored on all the capacitors by also using the voltage provided on the diagram.

$$
\begin{align*}
Q&=CV\\
Q&=17.22\;\mu\text{F} * 10\;\text{V}\\
Q&=172.2\mu\text{C}
\end{align*}
$$

## 16.0 Light

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/212.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

Light is a _wave_ of changing electric and magnetic fields. Light waves are caused by disturbances in an electromagnetic field, like the acceleration of charged particles (such as electrons). Light has a dual nature; at times, it acts like waves, while at other times it acts like particles, called _photons_. Light travels through space at the maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics, called the speed of light. Light has no mass, but it carries energy and momentum. Fermat's principle states that _light will always take the path that takes the least amount of time_ (not distance).

Fermat’s Principle governs the paths light will take and explains the familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering and color absorption and dispersion. Light rarely travels in a straight line path. When photons interact with electrons in matter, the time it takes for this interaction determines the path. For example, higher frequency blue light is refracted more than red because blue interacts more frequently with electrons. Also, the path of least time is achieved when blue light bends more than red light so that it gets out of the 'slow' region faster. Fermat’s Principle explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from rainbows to sunsets to the halos around the moon.



</article>

### 16.1 Speed of Light

<article>

Light travels at $3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$. We call this value _c_. Light can never travel at any other [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed"). Although when light travels through materials, due to scattering and absorption it appears that light is going slightly slower (see [refraction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/14.2/primary/lesson/refraction-of-light-phys "refraction") lesson for more detail). A light year is the amount of [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") light covers in a time of one year. The value of one light year is simply the speed of light multiplied by the number of seconds in a year and is roughly equal to $9.4 \times 10^{15} \text{m}$ . Viewing distant stars is looking back in time. The stars we see are many thousands of light years away, which means the light takes many thousands of years to reach us. Thus the stars we see in the sky are how they looked thousands of years ago.

> ###   Key Equations
> 
> $D = ct$; distance is equal to the speed of light multiplied by the time it has traveled

#### Example

How long after texting your friend on Mars will he receive it?

Mars is a distance of $3.1 \times 10^{11} \text{m}$. Thus, using the equation $t = \frac{D}{c} = \frac{3.1 \times 10^{11} \text{m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}}$ = 1033 seconds or about 17 minutes.

### Review

1.  Our sun is 8 “light minutes” from earth.
    1.  Using the speed of light as $c$ calculate the earth-sun distance in $m$, then convert it to miles (one mile = 1609 m)
    2.  The nearest galaxy to our Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy, 2 million light years away. How far away is the Andromeda Galaxy in miles?
2.  The Canis Major Dwarf galaxy is $2.364 \times 10^{20} \text{m}$ .
    1.  How far is it in light years?
    2.  If the galaxy were to disappear, how long until we notice it vanish on Earth?
3.  Light does not travel infinitely fast – its speed in a vacuum is $3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$. We measure very large astronomical distances in “light years” (LY) – the distance light travels in one year. The closest star beyond our sun is Alpha Centauri, 4 LY away. Some distant quasars are 2 billion LY away. Why do astronomers say that to look at these distant objects is to look back in time? Explain briefly.

### Review (Answers)

2.  a. About 25,000 cyr b. It would take us about 25,000 cyr to notice
3.  We are seeing what happened 2 billion years ago because it takes the light 2 billion years to get from the quasar to earth.

### 16.2 Color

<article>

 

White light consists of a mixture of all the visible colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV). Our perception of the color black is tied to the _absence_ of light. Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive cells. The three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can have sensitivity in three colors: red, blue, and green. Our perception of other colors is made from the _relative amounts_ of each color that the cones register from light reflected from the object we are looking at. Our brightness-sensitive cells (rods) work well in low light. This is why things look ‘black and white’ at night.

The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes – like those in a colorful shirt – absorb light at frequencies that correspond to certain colors. When you shine white light on these pigments and dyes, some colors are absorbed and some colors are reflected. We only see the colors that objects _reflect_. _Beautiful sunsets_ are another manifestation of Rayleigh scattering that occurs when light travels long distances through the atmosphere. The blue light and some green is scattered away, making the sun appear red.

#### Color Addition

![0](media/213.png "Figure 1: | **_Red_** | **_Green_** | **_Blue_** | **_Perceived color_** |")
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | white |
|     |     |     | black |
| $\checkmark$ |     | $\checkmark$ | magenta |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |     | yellow |
|     | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | cyan |

#### Example

In a dark room a blue light is shined on a magenta shirt what color does it appear? How about a yellow shirt? 

Since magenta is the combination of red and blue and only blue light is available to be reflected, the shirt will appear blue. As for the yellow shirt, there is no blue light in yellow (yellow is the combination of red and green), thus the shirt will appear black since no light is reflected off it.

### Review

1.  Consult the color table for human perception under the ‘Key Concepts’ section and answer the questions which follow.
    1.  Your coat looks magenta in white light. What color does it appear in blue light? In green light?
    2.  Which secondary color would look black under a blue light bulb?
    3.  You look at a cyan-colored ribbon under white light. Which of the three primary colors is your eye _not_ detecting?
2.  The **primary** colors of light are red, green, and blue. This is due to the way our eyes see color and the chemical reactions in the cone cells of the retina. Mixing these colors will produce the **secondary**, or complementary colors: magenta, cyan and yellow, as well as white. On the diagram below label colors to show how this works: ![0](media/214.png)\[Figure 2\]
3.  Color printers use a different method of color mixing: color mixing by **subtraction**. What colors are used in this process? (HINT: look at the ink colors in an ink-jet printer, CYMB). The idea here is that each color **subtracts** from the reflected light – for example, cyan ink reflects blue and green but SUBTRACTS red. Explain with diagrams how CYM can be combined to produce red, blue, and green.
4.  Answer the following light transmission questions
    1.  A beam of cyan light passes into a yellow filter. What color emerges?
    2.  A beam of yellow light passes into a magenta filter. What color emerges?

### 16.3 Electromagnetic Spectrum

<article>

 

When charged particles _accelerate_, changing electric and magnetic fields radiate outward. The traveling electric and magnetic fields of an accelerating (often oscillating) charged particle are known as electromagnetic radiation or light. When using the [wave equation](/c/physics/wave-equation "wave equation") for light keep in mind that light always travels at the [speed of light](/c/physics/speed-of-light "speed of light"). So plug in _c_ for _v_ in the wave equation. The color of light that we observe is a measure of the [wavelength](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.6/primary/lesson/wavelength-ms-ps "wavelength") of the light: the _longer_ the wavelength, the _redder_ the light.

The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly broken into the following ranges:

| $x-$ray | $10^{-11} \;\mathrm{m} - 10^{-8} \;\mathrm{m}$ | hydrogen atom |
| ultraviolet (UV) | $10^{-8} \;\mathrm{m} - 10^{-7} \;\mathrm{m}$ | small molecule |
| violet (visible) | $\sim 4\times10^{-7} \;\mathrm{m} (400 \;\mathrm{nm})^*$ | typical molecule |
| blue (visible) | $\sim 450 \;\mathrm{nm}$ | typical molecule |
| green (visible) | $\sim 500 \;\mathrm{nm}$ | typical molecule |
| red (visible) | $\sim 650 \;\mathrm{nm}$ | typical molecule |
| infrared (IR) | $10^{-6} \;\mathrm{m} - 1 \;\mathrm{mm}$ | human hair |

Which has a higher frequency, green light or [microwaves](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/18.6/primary/lesson/microwaves-ms-ps "microwaves")?

Green light has a higher frequency than microwaves. It is possible to calculate it, but since the [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") of an electromagnetic wave is constant we know that waves with higher wavelengths must have a lower frequency based on the wave equation.

#### Example 2

Calculate the frequency for an ultraviolet wave of wavelength $10^{-7}\;\text{m}$ and compare it to the frequency of a radio wave (about $3*10^9\;\text{Hz}$). Which type of wave do you think takes more [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") to generate?

We'll use the wave equation to determine the wave length of ultraviolet light.

$$
\begin{align*}
c&=f\lambda\\
f&=\frac{c}{\lambda}\\
f&=\frac{3*10^8\;\text{m/s}}{10^{-7}\;\text{m}}\\
f&=3*10^{14}\;\text{Hz}\\
\end{align*}
$$

The oscillating charged particles that create UV light are vibrating much more violently than the ones that create [radio waves](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/18.5/primary/lesson/radio-waves-ms-ps "radio waves") so they take more energy to generate.

### 16.4 Refraction

<article>

 

Fermat's principle states that light will always take the path that takes the least amount of time (not distance). Refraction follows from this. When light travels from air into another material (like glass), its [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") through the material is reduced due to interactions between photons that make up the light ray and the densely packed atoms of the material. Because light is effectively moving slower in the glass, for example, as compared to air, the light ray bends in order to get out quicker and satisfy Fermat's Principle of least time. This is called refraction. The figure below demonstrates the refraction a light ray experiences as it passes from air into a rectangular piece of glass and out again.

### 16.5 Total Internal Reflection

<article>

 

**Total internal reflection** occurs when light goes from a slow (high index of refraction) medium to a fast (low index of refraction) medium. With total internal reflection, light refracts so much it actually refracts back into the first medium. This is how fiber optic cables work: no light leaves the wire.

> ### Key Equation
> 
> $\theta_C = sin^{-1}\frac{n_2}{n_1} \;$ ; where $\theta_C$ is the critical angle, n<sub>1</sub> is the index of [refraction](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/14.2/primary/lesson/refraction-of-light-phys "refraction") of the material where the light emanates from and n<sub>2</sub> is the index of the material outside.

#### Example

You have some unknown material and you would like to determine it's index of refraction. You find that you are able to create total internal reflection when the material submerged in water, but not when submerged in cooking oil. (a) Can you give a range for the index of refraction? (b) you are able to determine the critical angle in water to be 71.8 degrees; what is the index of refraction of this material?

(a): The index of refraction of this material must be between 1.33 (water) and 1.53 (cooking oil). We know this because total internal reflection was not observed when the unknown material was submerged in oil, thus oil must have a higher refractive index than the unknown material.

(b): We can use the equation given above to determine the index of refraction of the unknown material.

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta_c&=sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2}{n_1})\\
n_1&=\frac{n_2}{\sin(\theta_c)}\\
n_1&=\frac{1.33}{\sin(71.8)}\\
n_1&=1.40\\
\end{align*}

### 16.6 Mirrors

<article>

 

Mirrors are made from highly reflective metal that is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass. Converging mirrors can be used to focus light – headlights, telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely on this principle. Converging mirrors (also known as concave mirrors) are curved towards the incoming light and focus parallel rays at the focal point. Diverging mirrors (also known as convex mirrors) are curved away from the incoming light and do not focus, but scatter the light instead.

The focal length, $f$, of a lens or mirror is the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the surface of the lens or mirror to the place where the light is focused. This is called the _focal point_ or _focus_. For diverging mirrors, there is no true focal point (i.e. real light does not focus), so the focal length is negative. 

When light rays converge in front of a mirror, a _real_ image is formed. Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph.

When light rays diverge in front of a mirror, a _virtual_ image is formed. A virtual image is formed by your brain tracing diverging rays backwards and is kind of a trick, like the person you see “behind” a mirror’s surface when you brush your teeth (there's obviously no real light focused _behind_ a mirror!). Since virtual images aren’t actually “anywhere,” you can’t place photographic film anywhere to capture them.

Real images are upside-down, or _inverted_. You can make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than the focal length. Virtual images are typically right-side-up. You can make virtual images by moving the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal length.

### Key Equations

In the problems below that considers converging or diverging mirrors, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays for virtual images). It is best if you can use different colors for the three different ray tracings. When sketching diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the extrapolated lines behind a mirror in order to produce the virtual image. When comparing measured distances and heights to calculated distances and heights, values within 10% are considered “good.” Use the **Table** ([below](#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Y2hlYXRzaGVldA..)) as your guide.

| Mirror type | Ray tracings |
| --- | --- |
| Converging mirrors<br><br>(**concave**) | Ray #1: Leaves tip of candle, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects back through focus.<br><br>Ray #2: Leaves tip, travels through focus, reflects back parallel to optic axis.<br><br>Ray #3: Leaves tip, reflects off center of mirror with an angle of [reflection](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/reflection-of-light-phys "reflection") equal to the angle of incidence. |
| Diverging mirrors<br><br>(**convex**) | Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the OPPOSITE side as the candle.<br><br>Ray #2: Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel to the optic axis.<br><br>Ray #3: Leaves tip, heads straight for the mirror center, and reflects at an equal angle. |

#### Example

In the situation illustrated below, the object is set up .5 m away from a converging mirror. If the focal length of the lens is .2 m, determine (a) the location of the real image, and (b) the magnification of the image.

![0](media/218.png "Figure 1: (a): In order to determine the location of the image, we'll use the lens maker's equation.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{f}&=\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}\\
\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}\\
\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{.2\;\text{m}} - \frac{1}{.5\;\text{m}}\\
d_i&=.33\;\text{m}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b): Now that we have the location of the image, we can find the magnification.

$$
\begin{align*}
M&=\frac{-d_i}{d_o}\\
M&=\frac{-.33\;\text{m}}{.5\;\text{m}}\\
M&=-\frac{2}{3}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 16.7 Lens

<article>

For lenses, the [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") from the center of the lens to the focus is $f$. Focal lengths for foci behind the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the object in question is $d_0$, where distances to the left of the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the image is $d_i$. This number is positive for real images (formed to the right of the lens), and negative for virtual images (formed to the left of the lens).

**Lenses**, made from curved pieces of glass, focus or de-focus light as it passes through. Lenses that focus light are called **converging lenses**, and these are the ones used to make telescopes and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light are called **diverging lenses**. Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called images.

The **focal length**, $f$, of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens to the place where the light is focused. This is called the **_focal point_** or **focus**. For diverging lenses, the focal length is negative. For converging lens, one can find the focal point by simply holding a piece of paper near the lens until a distant image is formed. The distance from the paper to the lens is the focal point.

![0](media/223.png "Figure 1: When light rays converge behind a lens, a **real image** is formed.

#### Example

You have a converging lens of focal length 2 units. If you place an object 5 units away from the lens, (a) draw a ray diagram of the situation to estimate where the image will be and (b) list the charactatistics of the image. Finally (c) calculate the position of the image. A diagram of the situation is shown below.

![0](media/225.png "Figure 3: (a): To draw the ray diagram, we'll follow the steps laid out above for converging lenses.")

First we draw the a ray that travels parallel to the principle axis and refracts through the focus on the other side (the red ray). Next we draw a ray through the focus on the same side that refracts out parallel (the green ray). Finally we draw the ray that travels straight through the center of the lens without refracting (the blue ray). The result is shown below.

![0](media/226.png "Figure 4: (b): Based on the ray diagram and the initial position of the object, we know that the image is a real, inverted, and smaller than the original object.")

(c): To calculate the exact position of the object, we can use the lens maker's equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{f}&=\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}\\
\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}\\
\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{1}{2\;\text{units}} - \frac{1}{5\;\text{units}}\\
\frac{1}{d_i}&=\frac{3}{10\;\text{units}}\\

### 16.8 Diffraction

Waves are characterized by their ability to constructively and destructively _interfere_. Light waves which interfere with themselves after interaction with a small aperture or target are said to _diffract_. Light creates interference patterns when passing through holes (“slits”) in an obstruction such as paper or the surface of a CD, or when passing through a thin film such as soap.

m \lambda = d \sin{\theta}
$$

$\text{d = spacing of slits}$

$\text{m = number of maximum (i.e. m = 0 is the central maximum, m = 1 is the 1st maximum and thus the first dot to the right and left of the center, etc.)}$

$\text{L = distance form diffraction grating to screen}$

$\Delta y = \text{distance from nth spot out from the center (if m = 1 then it is the 1st spot)}$

Remember, **maximum** = place where waves constructively interfere, and **minimum** = place where waves destructively interfere.

Because the screen distance _L_ is much larger than the slit distance _d_, one can see that

$\frac{\Delta y}{L} = \text{tan} \theta \approx \text{sin} \theta$.

Thus, the condition for a first maximum becomes

$\lambda = d \sin{\theta} = d \frac{\Delta y}{L}$

One can now easily calculate where the first maximum should appear if given the [wavelength](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.6/primary/lesson/wavelength-ms-ps "wavelength") of the laser light, the distance to the screen and the distance between slits.

First Maximum: $\Delta y = \frac {L \lambda}{d}$

#### Example 2

White light (which is comprised of all wavelengths and thus all colors) separates into a rainbow pattern as shown below.

![0](media/231.png "Figure 2: Each wavelength of light has a unique interference pattern given by the equation above. Thus all the wavelengths (i.e. colors) have a unique $\Delta y$ based on the equation given at the end of Example 1.

## 17.0 Fluids

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/232.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

In studying fluids we apply the concepts of force, momentum, and energy — which we have learned previously — to new phenomena. Since fluids are made from a large number of individual molecules, we have to look at their behavior as an ensemble and not individually. For this reason, we use the concept of conservation of _energy density_ in place of conservation of energy. Energy density is energy divided by volume. Newtonian fluids (the normal type and only type we deal with here) are non-compressible. This leads to Pascal's and Archimedes' Principles discussed below.



</article>

### 17.1 Buoyancy

<article>

 

**Archimedes’ Principle** states that the upward buoyant force on an object in the water is equal to the [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") of the displaced volume of water. The reason for this upward force is that the bottom of the object is at lower depth, and therefore higher pressure, than the top. If an object has a higher density than the density of water, the weight of the displaced volume will be less than the object’s weight, and the object will sink. Otherwise, the object will float. The ratio of an object or substance's density to the density of water is called it's specific gravity.

> ### Key Equations
> 
> $F_{\text{buoy}}= \rho_{\text{water}} g V_{\text{displaced}} \  ;$ Archimedes' Principle



#### Example

A simple boat (really a metal box with an open top) is floating at rest in a pond. The boat is 3 m long, 2 m wide, and has walls 1.5 m high and has an empty mass of 500 kg. If you begin filling the boat with gravel of density 1922 kg/m_3_ at a constant rate of .1 m_3_/s, how long will it be before your boat sinks?

To solve this problem, we're going to start out by determining the maximum mass that the boat can support. The weight of the maximum mass is equal to the buoyant force when the boat is submerged all the way up the the edge of the side wall.

$$
\begin{align*}
mg&=F_{buoy}\\
mg&=\rho_{water}gV\\
m&=\rho_{water}V\\
m&=1000\;\text{kg/m}^3 * 3\;\text{m} * 2\;\text{m} * 1.5\;\text{m}\\
m&=9000\;\text{kg}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Now we need to convert the rate at which sand is being added from m_3_/s to kg/s.

$$
.1\;\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}} * 1922\;\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3} = 192.2\;\text{kg/s}
$$

Now, we can set up something that resembles a linear equation where the 192.2 kg/s is m, t is x, the empty weight of the boat is b, and the maximum weight of the boat is y.

$$
\begin{align*}
9000\;\text{kg}&=192.2\;\text{kg/s} * t + 500\;\text{kg}\\
t&=\frac{9000\;\text{kg} - 500\;\text{kg}}{192.2\;\text{kg/s}}\\
t&=44.2\;\text{s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

### 17.2 Pressure in Fluids

<article>

 

The pressure of a fluid is a measure of the forces exerted by a large number of molecules when they collide and bounce off its boundary. The unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa). In a fluid at rest, pressure increases linearly with depth – this is due to the [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") of the water above it. Pascal’s Principle reminds us that, for a fluid of uniform pressure, the force exerted on a small area in contact with the fluid will be smaller than the force exerted on a large area. Thus, a small force applied to a small area in a fluid can create a large force on a larger area. This is the principle behind hydraulic machinery.

Liquids obey a continuity equation which is based on the fact that liquids are very difficult to compress. This means that the total volume of a fluid will remain constant in most situations. Imagine trying to compress a filled water balloon!

#### Example

A weather balloon is ascending through the atmosphere. If the density of air is 1.2 kg/m_3_ and [atmospheric pressure](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/12.3/primary/lesson/air-pressure-and-altitude-ms-ps "atmospheric pressure") at sea level is 101.3 kPa, then what is the pressure on the balloon at (a) 100 m above the ground, (b) 500 m above the ground, and (c) 1000 m above the ground?

For all parts of these problems, we'll be using the equation for pressure given above where the atmospheric pressure at sea level is P<sub>o</sub>.

(a):

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=P_o-\rho_{air}gh\\
P&=101.3\;\text{kPa} - 1.2\;\text{kg/m}^3 * 9.8\;\text{m/s}^2 * 100\;\text{m}\\
P&=100.12\;\text{kPa}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(b):

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=101.3\;\text{kPa} - 1.2\;\text{kg/m}^3 * 9.8\;\text{m/s}^2 * 500\;\text{m}\\
P&=95.4\;\text{kPa}\\
\end{align*}
$$

(c):

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=101.3\;\text{kPa} - 1.2\;\text{kg/m}^3 * 9.8\;\text{m/s}^2 * 1000\;\text{m}\\
P&=89.5\;\text{kPa}\\

## 18.0 Thermodynamics and Heat Engines

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/237.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Ideas")

Heat is a form of energy transfer. It can change the kinetic energy of a substance. For example, the average molecular kinetic energy of gas molecules is related to temperature. A heat engine turns a portion of the input heat (thermal energy) into mechanical work. A second portion of the input heat must be exhausted in order for the engine to have repetitive motion. Therefore, in a practical engine it is impossible for all the input heat to be converted to work.

Entropy is a measure of disorder, or the variety of ways in which a system can organize itself with the same total energy. The entropy of any isolated system always tends to disorder (i.e. entropy is always increasing). In the universe, the entropy of a subset (like evolution on Earth) can decrease (i.e. more order) but the total entropy of the universe is increasing (i.e. more disorder).

Thermodynamics is the study of heat engines. Any engine or power plant obeys the laws of thermodynamics. The _first law of thermodynamics_ is a statement of conservation of energy. Total energy, including heat, is conserved in any process and in the complete cycle of a heat engine. The _second law of thermodynamics_ as it applies to heat engines gives an absolute limit on the efficiency of any heat engine that goes through repetitious cycles.

### 18.1 Temperature

<article>

 

When an object feels cold to the touch, it is because [heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "heat") is flowing from you to the object. When an object feels hot to the touch, it is because heat is flowing from the object to you. Some objects (like metals) conduct heat better than others (like wood). Thus if you stick a metal rod in the fireplace and hold the other end, the heat is conducted well and you get burned. On the other hand, if you place a wood stick in the fire and hold the other end you’ll be OK.

The temperature of a gas is a measure of the amount of average [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") that the atoms in the gas possess. If you heat something, you increase its internal [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy"), so you increase the movement of molecules that make up this thing, thus it expands. This is called heat expansion; most everything expands as heated and contracts as cooled. Most materials expand as they are heated. This can cause bridges to collapse if they are not designed to have a place to expand in the summer months (like the placing of metal ‘teeth’ at intervals on the Golden Gate Bridge).

Water _contracts_ from $0^\circ C$ to $4^\circ C$ and then expands from $4^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$. Remembering that density is mass divided by volume explains why water at $4^\circ C$ is more dense than water below and above $4^\circ C$. This also explains why lakes freeze on the top first and not throughout. As the water on the top of the lake drops below $4^\circ C$, it is now more dense than the water below it, thus it sinks to the bottom, allowing the warmer water to rise up to the top and cool down in the winter weather. Only when the entirety of the lake is at $4^\circ C$, then the lake can start to freeze. It freezes from the top down, because water below $4^\circ C$ is less dense than water at $4^\circ C$. More than 50% of the water rise expected from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of water

![0](media/238.png "Figure 1: There are 3 different temperature scales you should know-the Kelvin scale, the Celsius scale and the Fahrenheit scale. The Kelvin scale (K) is the one used in most scientific equations and has its zero value set at _absolute zero_ (the theoretical point at which all motion stops). The Celsius scale $(^\circ C)$ is the standard SI temperature scale. It is equal to the Kelvin scale if you minus 273 from the Celsius reading. Water has a boiling point of $100^\circ C$ and a freezing point of $0^\circ C$. The Fahrenheit scale $(^\circ F)$ is the English system and the one we are familiar with.")

**Newtons’ Law of Cooling:** The rate of heat transfer is proportional to the difference in temperature between the two objects. For example, hot liquid that is put in the freezer will cool much faster than a room temperature liquid that is put in the same freezer.

#### Kinetic Theory of Gases

According to classical kinetic theory, temperature is always proportional to the average kinetic energy of molecules in a substance. The constant of proportionality, however, is not always the same.

Consider: the only way to increase the kinetic energies of the atoms in a mono-atomic gas is to increase their translational velocities. Accordingly, we assume that the kinetic energies of such atoms are stored equally in the three components ($x,y, \text{ and } z$) of their velocities.

On the other hand, other gases --- called diatomic --- consist of two atoms held by a bond. This bond can be modeled as a spring, and the two atoms and bond together as a harmonic oscillator. Now, a single molecule's kinetic energy can be increased _either by increasing its speed, by making it vibrate in [simple harmonic motion](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/11.1/primary/lesson/simple-harmonic-motion-phys "simple harmonic motion"), or by making it rotate around its center of mass_. This difference is understood in physics through the concept of **degrees of freedom**: each degree of freedom for a molecule or particle corresponds to a possibility of increasing its kinetic energy independently of the kinetic energy in other degrees.

It might seem that monatomic gases should have one degree of freedom: their [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity"). They have three because their velocity can be altered in one of three mutually perpendicular directions without changing the kinetic energy in other two --- just like a [centripetal force](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/5.2/primary/lesson/centripetal-force-phys "centripetal force") does not change the kinetic energy of an object, since it is always perpendicular to its velocity. These are called translational degrees of freedom.

Diatomic gas molecules, on the other hand have more: the three translational explained above still exist, but there are now also vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Monatomic and diatomic degrees of freedom can be illustrated like this:

![0](media/239.png "Figure 2: Temperature is an _average of kinetic energy over degrees of freedom, not a sum_. Let's try to understand why this is in reference to our monoatomic ideal gas. In the derivation above, volume was constant; so, temperature was essentially proportional to pressure, which in turn was proportional to the kinetic energy **due to translational motion** of the molecules. If the molecules had been able to rotate as well as move around the box, they could have had the same kinetic energy with slower translational velocities, and, therefore, lower temperature. In other words, in that case, or assumption that the kinetic energy of the atoms only depends on their velocities, implied between equations \[2. and \[3\], would not have held. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom in a substance determines the proportionality between molecular kinetic energy and temperature: the more degrees of freedom, the more difficult it will be to raise its temperature with a given energy input. This is why it takes so long to boil water but so little time to heat up a piece of metal with the same mass.")

> ### A note about the above discussion:
> 
> Since the objects at the basis of our understanding of thermodynamics are atoms and molecules, quantum effects can make certain degrees of freedom inaccessible at specific temperature ranges. Unlike most cases in your current physics class, where these can be ignored, in this case, quantum effects can make an appreciable difference. For instance, the vibrational degrees of freedom of diatomic gas molecules discussed above are, for many gases, inaccessible in very common conditions, although we do not have the means to explain this within our theory. In fact, this was one of the first major failures of classical physics that ushered in the revolutionary discoveries of the early 20th century.

#### Example 1

Convert 75 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius.

To do this conversion, we'll just use the equation given above.

$$
\begin{align*}
T_c&=\frac{5}{9}(T_f - 32^\circ \text{F})\\
T_c&=\frac{5}{9}(75^\circ \text{F} - 32^\circ \text{F})\\
T_c&=23.8^\circ \text{C}
\end{align*}
$$

#### Example 2

The mass of a neon atom is $3.34*10^{-26}\;\text{kg}$. If the temperature of the neon atom 100 K, what is it's [average velocity](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/2.2/primary/lesson/average-velocity-phys "average velocity")?

We can solve this problem using the equation given above relating kinetic energy to the temperature of a gas.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}mv^2&=\frac{3}{2}kT\\
v&=\sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}\\
v&=\sqrt{\frac{3*1.38*10^{-23}\;\text{J/K} * 100\;\text{K}}{3.34*10^{-26}\;\text{kg}}}\\
v&=352.1\;\text{m/s}\\
\end{align*}
$$

2.  Convert $70^\circ \text{F}$ to Celsius
3.  The temperature of the box is related to the average speed of the molecules. Use momentum principles to relate temperature to pressure. Explain conceptually, in words rather than with equations.
4.  Explain why a lake freezes at the top first, rather than throughout or at the bottom? ![0](media/240.png)\[Figure 3\]
5.  Typical room temperature is about $300 \;\mathrm{K}$. As you know, the air in the room contains both $O_2$ and $N_2$ gases, with nitrogen the lower mass of the two. If the average kinetic energies of the oxygen and nitrogen gases are the same (since they are at the same temperature), which gas has a higher average speed?
6.  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules. Consider a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas at a certain temperature. Use the formula for kinetic energy to explain why the hydrogen molecules move faster than the oxygen molecules. Then explain why there’s no hydrogen in the earth’s atmosphere, and why the moon has no atmosphere at all.
7.  Calculate the average speed of $N_2$ molecules at room temperature $(300 \;\mathrm{K})$. (You remember from your chemistry class how to calculate the mass (in $kg$) of an $N_2$ molecule, right?)
8.  How high would the temperature of a sample of $O_2$ gas molecules have to be so that the average speed of the molecules would be $10$% the speed of light? Convert this temperature to Kelvin and Fahrenheit as well.

### 18.2 Specific Heat and Phase Change

<article>

The amount of [heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "heat") capacitance (and thus its [specific heat](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/9.3/primary/lesson/specific-heat-phys "specific heat") value) is related to something called ‘degrees of freedom,’ which basically says how free is the object to move in different ways (and thus how much [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") can it store inside itself without breaking apart). For example, solids have a more fixed structure, so they cannot rotate and jostle as much, so they can’t store as much internal [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") so they have lower heat capacitance then liquids.

**Specific heat** is similar to heat capacitance, but is a specific number. The specific heat tells you how much energy one must put in per unit mass in order to raise the [temperature](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/temperature-ms-ps "temperature") $1^\circ C$.

**Phase changes**: it takes energy to changes phases from a solid to a liquid and from a liquid to a gas. The substance releases energy when changing phase from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. How much energy per unit mass depends on the substance in question. When you get out of the shower you often feel cold. This is because the water on you is evaporating, and heat is flowing from you to the water droplets in order for them to change phase from water to gas. You are losing heat and thus feel cold.

A calorie is a unit of energy. The food Calorie, with a capital $C$, is actually 1,000 calories (a kcal). Thus, for example, a snicker bar labeled with 200 Cal is actually 200,000 cal.

Food calories are determined by burning the food and measuring the heat released.

During a phase change, the number of degrees of freedom changes, and so does the specific heat capacity. Heat capacity can also depend on temperature within a given phase, but many substances, under constant pressure, exhibit a constant specific heat over a wide range of temperatures. For instance, look at the graph of temperature vs heat input for a **mole** ($6.0221415 \times 10^{23}$ molecules) of water below.

![0](media/241.png "Figure 1: Note that the x-axis of this graph is called 'relative heat energy' because it takes a mole of water at 0 degrees Celsius as the reference point.")

The sloped segments on the graph represent increases in temperature. The flat segments represent phase transitions, governed by equation for latent heat. Notice that the sloped segments have constant, though different, slopes. According to this equation, the heat capacity at any particular phase would be the slope of the segment that corresponds to that phase on the graph. The fact that the slopes are constant means that, within a particular phase, the heat capacity does not change significantly as a function of temperature. **Heat capacity** is the amount of internal energy that the substance can store. A large heat capacitance means the substance can store a lot of internal energy and thus the temperature changes slowly. Aluminum foil has a small heat capacitance and water has a large one.

> ###   Key Equations

#### Example

A 500 g piece of aluminum metal of unknown temperature is thrown into a cup containing 500 g of water which had an initial temperature of $20^\circ C$. If the final temperature of both the aluminum and the water was $25^\circ C$, what was the starting temperature of the metal? Use the table above to find the specific heat of water and aluminum.

The key to this problem is connecting it with [conservation of energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.7/primary/lesson/conservation-of-energy-phys "conservation of energy"). The energy that went into heating up the water must have come from heat stored in the metal. Therefore, we know that the change in energy of the water is equal to however much energy the aluminum lost when it was put into the water. When solving this problem, we'll call the energy of the aluminum $Q_A$ and the energy of the water $Q_w$.

$$
\begin{align*}
-\Delta Q_A&=\Delta Q_w && \text{start with conservation of energy}\\
-m_Ac_A\Delta T_A&=m_wc_w\Delta T_w && \text{substitute in the values for each energy term based on the equation given above}\\
\Delta T_A&=-\frac{m_wc_w\Delta T_w}{m_Ac_A} && \text{solve for } \Delta T_a\\
T_f - T_i&=-\frac{m_wc_w\Delta T_w}{m_Ac_A} && \text{substitute in the initial and final temperatures for } \Delta T_A\\
T_i&=T_f + \frac{m_wc_w\Delta T_w}{m_Ac_A} && \text{solve for } T_i\\
T_i&=25^\circ C + \frac{500\;\text{g} * 1\;\text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C} * (25^\circ C - 20^\circ C)}{500\;\text{g} * .215\;\text{cal/g}^\circ \text{C}} && \text{plug in all the known values}\\
T_i&=48.2^\circ C\\
\end{align*}

### 18.3 Gas Pressure and Force

<article>

 

The pressure of a gas is the force the gas exerts on a certain area. For a gas in a container, the amount of pressure is directly related to the number and intensity of atomic collisions on a container wall.

An _ideal_ gas is a gas for which interactions between molecules are negligible, and for which the gas atoms or molecules themselves store no [potential energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.5/primary/lesson/potential-energy-phys "potential energy"). For an “ideal” gas, the pressure, [temperature](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/temperature-ms-ps "temperature"), and volume are simply related by the ideal gas law.

[Atmospheric pressure](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/12.3/primary/lesson/air-pressure-and-altitude-ms-ps "Atmospheric pressure") ($1 \;\mathrm{atm} = 101,000$ Pascals) is the pressure we feel at sea level due to the [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") of the atmosphere above us. As we rise in elevation, there is less of an atmosphere to push down on us and thus less pressure.

An ideal gas is a gas where the atoms are treated as point-particles and assumed to never collide or interact with each other. If you have $N$ molecules of such a gas at temperature $T$ and volume $V$, the pressure can be calculated from this formula. Note that $k=1.38\times10^{-23}\;\mathrm{J/K}$

\begin{align*}

5.  Why is it a good idea for Noreen to open her bag of chips before she drives to the top of a high mountain?

7.  Calculate the amount of force exerted on a $2 \;\mathrm{cm} \times 2 \;\mathrm{cm}$ patch of your skin due to atmospheric pressure $(P_0 = 101,000 \;\mathrm{Pa})$. Why doesn’t your skin burst under this force?
8.  Assuming that the pressure of the atmosphere decreases exponentially as you rise in elevation according to the formula $P = P_0 e^\frac{-h} {a}$, where $P_0$ is the atmospheric pressure at sea level $(101,000 \;\mathrm{Pa})$, $h$ is the altitude in km and _a_ is the _scale height_ of the atmosphere $(a \approx 8.4 \;\mathrm{km})$.

    6.  Is this number half the number from part (a)? Why or why not?
    7.  The closed container is now compressed isothermally so that the pressure rises to its original pressure. What is the new volume of the container?
    8.  Sketch this process on a P-V diagram.
    9.  Sketch cubes with volumes corresponding to the old and new volumes.

### Review (Answers)

1.  There will be more collisions because there is an increase in the number of particles in the box; therefore, the pressure will increase.
    
2.  To pop a balloon a threshold pressure must be achieved. Since the surface area of a needle is smaller than that of your finger, it will exert a higher pressure with the same amount of force. The size of the hole is not relevant since a balloon is popped by a hole of any size.
    
3.  The bottle crumples since it can no longer push back against atmospheric pressure.
    
4.  Drinking some of the liquid increases the empty volume in the cup, and so would decrease pressure on its walls if the number of gas molecules inside were constant. By the ideal gas law, we can see that the volume would decrease at constant temperature (the cup would crumple) unless more molecules are let in.
    
5.  On top of a mountain, the air pressure is lower than at sea level since there is less air pushing down on you (some of the atmosphere is below you), and so the bag of chips would be more inflated at the top of a high mountain. This would make it more difficult to open without spilling.

### 18.4 Heat Engine

<article>

 

[Heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "Heat") engines transform input heat into work in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, as we learned in the previous Concept, increasing the [temperature](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/temperature-ms-ps "temperature") of a gas at constant volume will increase its pressure. This pressure can be transformed into a force that moves a piston.

The mechanics of various heat engines differ but their fundamentals are quite similar and involve the following steps:

1.  Heat is supplied to the engine from some source at a higher temperature $(T_h)$.
2.  Some of this heat is transferred into mechanical [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy") through work done $(W)$.
3.  The rest of the input heat is transferred to some source at a lower temperature $(T_c)$ until the system is in its original state.

A single cycle of such an engine can be illustrated as follows:

![0](media/245.png "Figure 1: In effect, such an engine allows us to 'siphon off' part of the heat flow between the heat source and the heat sink. The [efficiency](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/13.5/primary/lesson/efficiency-ms-ps "efficiency") of such an engine is define as the ratio of net work performed to input heat; this is the fraction of heat energy converted to mechanical energy by the engine: ")

$$
\begin{align*}
e =  \frac{W}{Q_i} && \text{Efficiency of a heat engine}
\end{align*}
$$

If the engine does not lose energy to its surroundings (of course, all real engines do), then this efficiency can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{align*}
e = \frac{Q_i-Q_o}{Q_i}  && \text{Efficiency of a lossless heat engine}
\end{align*}
$$

An ideal engine, the most efficient _theoretically_ possible, is called a Carnot Engine. Its efficiency is given by the following formula, where the temperatures are, respectively, the temperature of the exhaust environment and the temperature of the heat input, in Kelvins. In a Carnot engine heat is input and exhausted in isothermal cycles, and the efficiency is $\eta = 1 -\frac{T_{\mathrm{cold}}}{T_\mathrm{hot}}$. In all real engines heat is lost to the environment, thus the ideal efficiency is never even close to being obtained.

The Stirling engine is a real life heat engine that has a cycle similar to the theoretical Carnot cycle. The Stirling engine is very efficient compared to a gasoline engine and could become an important player in today's world where green energy and efficiency will reign supreme.

In a practical heat engine, the change in internal energy must be zero over a complete cycle. Therefore, over a complete cycle $W =  \Delta Q$. The work done by a gas during a portion of a cycle = $P\Delta\!V$, note $\Delta\!V$can be positive or negative.

When gas pressure-forces are used to move an object then work is done on the object by the expanding gas. Work can be done on the gas in order to compress it. If you plot pressure on the vertical axis and volume on the horizontal axis, the work done in any complete cycle is the area enclosed by the graph. For a partial process, work is the area underneath the curve, or$P\Delta\!V$.



#### Example

A heat engine operates at a temperature of $650\mathrm{K}$. The work output is used to drive a pile driver, which is a [machine](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/7.2/primary/lesson/simple-machines-phys "machine") that picks things up and drops them. Heat is then exhausted into the atmosphere, which has a temperature of $300\mathrm{K}$.

a) What is the ideal efficiency of this engine?

We will plug the known values into the formula to get the ideal efficiency.

$$
\eta = 1 -\frac{T_{\mathrm{cold}}}{T_\mathrm{hot}}=1-\frac{300\mathrm{K}}{650\mathrm{K}}=54\%
$$

b) The engine drives a $1200\mathrm{kg}$ [weight](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/3.1/primary/lesson/mass-versus-weight-phys "weight") by lifting it $50m$ in $2.5 sec$. What is the engine’s power output?

To find the power of the engine, we will use the power equation and plug in the known values.

$$
P=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{Fd}{t}=\frac{mad}{t}=\frac{1200\mathrm{kg}\times  9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}\times 50\mathrm{m}}{2.5\mathrm{sec}}=240\mathrm{kW}
$$

c) If the engine is operating at $50\%$ of ideal efficiency, how much power is being consumed?



First, we know that it is operating at $50\%$ of ideal efficiency. We also know that the max efficiency of this engine is $54\%$. So the engine is actually operating at 

$$
.5\times  54\%=27\%
$$

 of $100\%$ efficiency. So $240\mathrm{kW}$ is $27\%$ of what? 

$$
.27x=240\mathrm{kW}  \Rightarrow x=\frac{240\mathrm{kW}}{.27}=890\mathrm{kW}
$$

d) How much power is exhausted?

Since we know how much power is being put into the engine and how much energy is actually being used to lift the weight, we can determine how much energy is not actually being used to do work.

$$
890\;\text{kW} - 240\;\text{kW}=650\;\text{kW}\\
$$

e) The fuel the engine uses is rated at $2.7\times  10^6\mathrm{J/kg}$. How many kg of fuel are used in one hour?

For this part of the problem, we need to convert the power being put into the engine into the amount of fuel being used(kW or kJ/s $\Rightarrow$ kg/hr).

$$
890\;\text{kW}*\frac{1\;\text{kg}}{2.7*10^6\;\text{J}} * 3600\;\text{s/hr}=1186\;\text{kg/hr}\\
$$

### Review

Below is a graph of the pressure and volume of a gas in a container that has an adjustable volume. The lid of the container can be raised or lowered, and various manipulations of the container change the properties of the gas within. The points $a, b,$ and $c$ represent different stages of the gas as the container undergoes changes (for instance, the lid is raised or lowered, heat is added or taken away, etc.) The arrows represent the flow of time. Use the graph to answer the first three questions.

## 19.0 Special and General Relativity

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/248.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Ideas")

Einstein believed that the laws of physics do not depend on the how fast you are moving through space: every _reference frame_ sees the same world of physics. In other words, if you are on a moving train and drop a ball or if you are standing on a farm and drop a ball, the physics that describe the motion of that ball will be the same. Einstein realized that the speed of light, c, should depend only on the laws of physics that describe light as electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, Einstein made the bold assertion that light always travels at the same speed, _no matter how fast you are moving with respect to the source of light_. Consider for a moment how counterintuitive this concept really is. This is the theoretical underpinning of Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity, one of the most successfully predictive theories of physics ever formulated.

The most important consequence of this new understanding is that our intuition that time moves at the same rate for everyone (whether standing still or moving at a fast speed) is WRONG. In fact, the rate at which time passes depends on your speed. Since Einstein’s work in the early part of the 20_th_ century, this fact has been demonstrated many times by experiments in particle accelerators and through the use of atomic clocks aboard fast moving jet airplanes. The effect is only noticeable at extremely fast speeds, thus the normal laws of motion apply in all but the most extreme cases.

Einstein was finally led to believe that the very fabric of space and time must have a more active and influential role in the laws of physics than had previously been believed. Eventually, Einstein became convinced that gravity itself amounted to no more than a curvature in _spacetime_. This theory is called General Relativity.

### 19.1 Time Dilation

<article>

The [speed of light](/c/physics/speed-of-light "speed of light") will always be measured to be the same (about $3\times10^8 \;\mathrm{m/s}$) _regardless_ of your motion towards or away from the source of light.

In order for this bizarre fact to be true, we must reconsider what we mean by ‘space,’ ‘time,’ and related concepts, such as the concept of ‘simultaneous’ events. (Events which are seen as simultaneous by one observer might appear to occur at different times to an observer moving with a different [velocity](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.6/primary/lesson/velocity-ms-ps "velocity"). Note that both observers see the same laws of physics, just a different sequence of events.)

Clocks moving towards or away from you run more slowly, and objects moving towards or away from you shrink in length. These are known as Lorentz time dilation and [length contraction](/c/physics/length-contraction "length contraction"); both are real, measured properties of the universe we live in.

### Review

1.  Suppose you discover a speedy subatomic particle that exists for a nanosecond before disintegrating. This subatomic particle moves at a speed close to the speed of light. Do you think the lifetime of this particle would be _longer_ or _shorter_ than if the particle were at rest?
2.  The muon particle $(\mu-)$ has a half-life of $2.20\times10^{-6} \;\mathrm{s}$. Most of these particles are produced in the atmosphere, a good $5-20 \;\mathrm{km}$ above Earth, yet we see them all the time in our detectors here on Earth. In this problem you will find out how it is possible that these particles make it all the way to Earth with such a short lifetime.
    1.  Calculate how far muons could travel before half decayed, without using relativity and assuming a speed of $0.999\;\mathrm{c}$ (i.e. $99.9$% of the speed of light)
    2.  Now calculate $\gamma$, for this muon.
    3.  Calculate its 'relativistic' half-life.
    4.  Now calculate the distance before half decayed using relativistic half-life and express it in kilometers. (This has been observed experimentally. This first experimental verification of time dilation was performed by Bruno Rossi at Mt. Evans, Colorado in 1939.)
3.  An alien spaceship moves past Earth at a speed of $.15 \;\mathrm{c}$ with respect to Earth. The alien clock ticks off $0.30$ seconds between two events on the spaceship. What will earthbound observers determine the time interval to be?
4.  Suppose your identical twin blasted into space in a space ship and is traveling at a speed of $0.100\;\mathrm{c}$. Your twin performs an experiment which he clocks at $76.0$ minutes. You observe this experiment through a powerful telescope; what duration does the experiment have according to your clock? Now the opposite happens and you do the $76.0$ minute experiment. How long does the traveling twin think the experiment lasted?

### 19.2 Length Contraction

<article>

 

Clocks moving towards or away from you run more slowly, and objects moving towards or away from you shrink in length. These are known as Lorentz [time dilation](/c/physics/time-dilation "time dilation") and length contraction; both are real, measured properties of the universe we live in.

$$
\beta = \frac{v}{c}
$$

An object moving with [speed](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.4/primary/lesson/speed-ms-ps "speed") $v$ has a dimensionless speed $\beta$ calculated by dividing the speed $v$ by the [speed of light](/c/physics/speed-of-light "speed of light") ($\mathit{c} = 3\times10^8 \;\mathrm{m/s}$). $0 \le \beta \le 1$.

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}
$$

The dimensionless Lorentz “gamma” factor $\gamma$ can be calculated from the speed, and tells you how much time dilation or length contraction there is. $1 \le \gamma \le \infty$.

$$
L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}
$$

If you see an object of length$L$ moving towards you at a Lorentz gamma factor $\gamma$, it will appear shortened (contracted) in the direction of motion to new length $L$ .

## 20.0 Radioactivity and Nuclear Physics

<article>

Introduction
------------

![0](media/249.png "Figure 1: ### The Big Idea")

The nuclei of atoms are affected by three forces: the strong nuclear force, which causes protons and neutrons to bind together, the electric force, which is manifested by repulsion of the protons and tends to rip the nucleus apart, and the weak nuclear force, which causes neutrons to change into protons and vice versa.

The strong force predominates and can cause nuclei of complex atoms with many protons to be stable. The electric force of repulsion is responsible for fission, the breaking apart of nuclei, and therefore also for atom bombs and nuclear power. A form of fission where a helium nucleus is a product, is called _alpha radiation._ The actions of the weak force give rise to _beta radiation._ A change in nuclear energy can also give rise to _gamma_ _radiation_, high energy electromagnetic waves. Particles that emit alpha radiation, beta radiation, and gamma radiation go through the process of _radioactive decay,_ which causes the heating of the molten core of the earth, and has even played a role in the mutations in our evolutionary history. Fission and fusion, the latter occurring when light nuclei combine to form new elements, are accompanied by copious amounts of gamma radiation. These processes often produce radioactive nuclei; in nature these radioactive nuclei were forged in the explosive deaths of ancient stars.

### 20.1 Radiation

<article>

![0](media/250.png "Figure 1: **Alpha decay** is the process in which an isotope releases a helium nucleus ($2$ protons and $2$ neutrons, $\frac{4}{2}\;\mathrm{He}$) and thus decays into an atom with two less protons.")

_Example:_  $\ ^{232}_{90} \;\mathrm{Th}\rightarrow\ ^{228}_{88}\;\mathrm{Ra}+\ ^{4}_{2}\;\mathrm{He}$

#### ![0](media/251.png)\[Figure 2\]

**Beta decay** is the process in which one of the neutrons in an isotope decays, leaving a proton, electron and anti-neutrino. As a result, the nucleus decays into an atom that has the same number of nucleons, with one neutron replaced by a proton. (Beta positive decay is the reverse process, in which a proton decays into a neutron, anti-electron and neutrino.)

___Example:_  $\ ^{14}_{6}\;\mathrm{C}\rightarrow\ ^{14}_{7}\;\mathrm{N}+\ ^{ 0}_{-1}\;\mathrm{e}^-+\;\mathrm{v}$__

_Example:_  $\ ^{14}_{6}\;\mathrm{C}\rightarrow\ ^{14}_{7}\;\mathrm{N}+\ ^{ 0}_{-1}\;\mathrm{e}^-+\;\mathrm{v}$

![0](media/252.png "Figure 3: **Gamma decay** is the process in which an excited atomic nucleus kicks out a photon and releases some of its [energy](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/14.1/primary/lesson/energy-ms-ps "energy"). The makeup of the nucleus doesn’t change, it just loses energy. (It can be useful to think of this as energy of motion – think of a shuddering nucleus that only relaxes after emitting some light.)")

___Example:_  $\ ^{137}_{56}\;\mathrm{Ba}^*\rightarrow\ ^{137}_{56}\;\mathrm{Ba+y}$__

_Example:_  $\ ^{137}_{56}\;\mathrm{Ba}^*\rightarrow\ ^{137}_{56}\;\mathrm{Ba+y}$

**Fission** is the process in which an atomic nucleus breaks apart into two less massive nuclei. Energy is released in the process in many forms, [heat](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/15.3/primary/lesson/heat-ms-ps "heat"), [gamma rays](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/18.9/primary/lesson/gamma-rays-ms-ps "gamma rays") and the [kinetic energy](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/6.6/primary/lesson/kinetic-energy-phys "kinetic energy") of neutrons. If these neutrons collide with nuclei and induce more fission, then a runaway _chain reaction_ can take place. Fission is responsible for nuclear energy and atom-bomb explosions: the fission of uranium acts as a heat source for the Earth’s molten interior.

___Example:_  $\ ^{1}\;\mathrm{n} + \ ^{235} \;\mathrm{U}\rightarrow\ ^{141}\;\mathrm{Ba} + \ ^{92}\;\mathrm{Kr}+3 ^{1}\;\mathrm{n}$__

_Example:_  $\ ^{1}\;\mathrm{n} + \ ^{235} \;\mathrm{U}\rightarrow\ ^{141}\;\mathrm{Ba} + \ ^{92}\;\mathrm{Kr}+3 ^{1}\;\mathrm{n}$

**Fusion** is the process in which two atomic nuclei fuse together to make a single nucleus. Energy is released in the form of nuclear particles, neutrons, and gamma-rays.

___Example:_  $\ ^{3}_{1}\;\mathrm{H} + \ ^{2}_{1}\;\mathrm{H} \rightarrow\ ^{4}_{2}\;\mathrm{He} + \ ^{1}_{0}\;\mathrm{n + y}$__

_Example:_  $\ ^{3}_{1}\;\mathrm{H} + \ ^{2}_{1}\;\mathrm{H} \rightarrow\ ^{4}_{2}\;\mathrm{He} + \ ^{1}_{0}\;\mathrm{n + y}$

Atomic symbols like $^A_Z X$ are interpreted in the following way: $X$ is the symbol for the element involved. For example, $U$ is the symbol for the element uranium. $Z$ is the atomic number. $A$ is the atomic mass number, the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). A would be $235$ for uranium.

The nuclear process is largely random in direction. Therefore, radiation strength decreases with [distance](/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/9.2/primary/lesson/distance-ms-ps "distance") by the inverse square of the distance (the $1/\mathit{r}^2$ law, which also holds for gravity, [electric fields](/cbook/ck-12-physics-flexbook-2.0/section/15.2/primary/lesson/the-electric-field-phys "electric fields"), light intensity, sound intensity, and so on.)

### 20.2 Half Life

<article>

 

Some of the matter on Earth is unstable and undergoing nuclear decay. **Alpha decay** is the emission of a helium nucleus and causes the product to have an atomic number $2$ lower than the original and an atomic mass number $4$ lower than the original. **Beta minus decay** is the emission of an electron, causing the product to have an atomic number $1$ greater than the original. **Beta plus decay** is the emission of a positron, causing the product to have an atomic number $1$ lower than the original.

When an atomic nucleus decays, it does so by releasing one or more particles. The atom often (but not always) turns into a different element during the decay process. The amount of radiation given off by a certain sample of radioactive material depends on the amount of material, how quickly it decays, and the nature of the decay product. Big, rapidly decaying samples are most dangerous.

The measure of how quickly a nucleus decays is given by the _half-life_ of the nucleus. One half-life is the amount of time it will take for half of the radioactive material to decay.

The type of atom is determined by the atomic number (i.e. the number of protons). The atomic mass of an atom is approximately the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. Typically, the atomic mass listed in a periodic table is an average, weighted by the natural abundances of different isotopes. The atomic mass number in a nuclear decay process is conserved. This means that you will have the same _total_ atomic mass number on both sides of the equation. Charge is also conserved in a nuclear process.

It is impossible to predict when an individual atom will decay; one can only predict the probability. However, it is possible to predict when a portion of a macroscopic sample will decay extremely accurately because the sample contains a vast number of atoms.

### 20.3 Carbon Dating

<article>

 

**Radioactive carbon dating** is a technique that allows scientists to determine the era in which a sample of biological material died. A small portion of the carbon we ingest every day is actually the radioactive isotope $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ rather than the usual $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. Since we ingest carbon every day until we die (we do this by eating plants; the plants do it through photosynthesis), the amount of $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ in us should begin to decrease from the moment we die. By analyzing the ratio of the number of $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ to $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ atoms in dead carbon-based life forms (including cloth made from plants!), we can determine how long ago the life form died.

#### Example

The half-life of $^{239}$Pu is $24,119$ years. You have $31.25$ micrograms left, and the sample you are studying started with $2000$ micrograms. How long has this rock been decaying?

We will use the equation for time and simply plug in the known values. 

$$
t=t_H\frac{\ln{\frac{N}{N_0}}}{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}=24119\mathrm{y}\frac{\ln{\frac{31.25\mu\mathrm{g}}{2000\mu\mathrm{g}}}}{\ln{\frac{1}{2}}}=144,700\mathrm{years}
$$

### Review

1.  The half-life of $^{239}\mathrm{Pu}$ is $24,119$ years. You have $31.25$ micrograms left, and the sample you are studying started with $2000$ micrograms. How long has this rock been decaying?
2.  A certain fossilized plant is $23,000$ years old. Anthropologist Hwi Kim determines that when the plant died, it contained $0.250 \;\mathrm{g}$ of radioactive $^{14}\mathrm{C} (t_H = 5730 \;\mathrm{years})$. How much should be left now?
3.  Jaya unearths a guinea pig skeleton from the backyard. She runs a few tests and determines that $99.7946$% of the original $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ is still present in the guinea pig’s bones. The half-life of $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ is $5730$ years. When did the guinea pig die?
4.  You use the carbon dating technique to determine the age of an old skeleton you found in the woods. From the total mass of the skeleton and the knowledge of its molecular makeup you determine that the amount of $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ it began with was $0.021$ grams. After some hard work, you measure the current amount of $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ in the skeleton to be $0.000054$ grams. How old is this skeleton? Are you famous?
5.  Micol had in her lab two samples of radioactive isotopes: $^{151}\mathrm{Pm}$ with a half-life of $1.183$ days and $^{134}\;\mathrm{Ce}$ with a half-life of $3.15$ days. She initially had $100 \;\mathrm{mg}$ of the former and $50 \;\mathrm{mg}$ of the latter.
    1.  Do a graph of quantity remaining (vertical axis) vs. time for both isotopes on the same graph.
    2.  _Using the graph_ determine at what time the quantities remaining of both isotopes are exactly equal and what that quantity is.
    3.  Micol can detect no quantities less than $3.00 \;\mathrm{mg}$. Again, _using the graph_, determine how long she will wait until each of the original isotopes will become undetectable.
    4.  The $Pm$ goes through $\beta-$ decay and the $Ce$ decays by means of electron capture. What are the two immediate products of the radioactivity?
    5.  It turns out both of these products are themselves radioactive; the $Pm$ product goes through $\beta-$ decay before it becomes stable and the $Ce$ product goes through $\beta+$ decay before it reaches a stable isotope. When all is said and done, what will Micol have left in her lab?
